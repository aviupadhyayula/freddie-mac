Sec. 23-3. Zoning map established. (a) The districts aforesaid and the boundaries of such districts as shown on the zoning map, which is on file in the office of the city clerk and designated as the zoning map of the city, are hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter. The zoning map and all notations, references, and other information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this chapter as if such matters and information set forth on the map were all fully described and set out thereon. (b) If, because of error or omission in the zoning map, any property in the city or that has been annexed into the city is not shown as being in a zoning district, the classification of such property shall be A-1, unless the A-1 district is not permitted according to the comprehensive plan, in which case compatible zoning will be enacted by amendment to this chapter.\n""} 
Sec. 23-4. Interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to boundaries of any district shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: (a) Where such district boundaries are indicated as approximately following street lines, alley lines, lot lines, or land use plan lines, such lines shall be construed to be boundaries. (b) In unsubdivided property, or where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundary, unless the same is indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map. (c) Where any street or alley is hereafter officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall apply to that portion of such street or alley added thereto by virtue of such vacation or abandonment. (d) Where a district boundary line divides a lot in a single ownership on April 2, 1962, the city commission may, in its discretion, permit a use authorized in either portion of such lot to extend to the entire lot.\n""} 
Sec. 23-5. Supplemental nature of district regulations. The provisions of this chapter shall be supplemental and not in lieu of all existing ordinances and regulations existing in the city, as specifically, the provisions of the official charter of the city.\n""} 
Sec. 23-6--23-7. Reserved.\n""} 
Sec. 23-8. Applicability.\n""} 
ARTICLE II. USE REGULATIONS No building shall be erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered, nor shall any building or land be used for any purpose other than as permitted herein by the district in which such building or land use is located. If there is a conflict between the land uses designated by this chapter and the city comprehensive land use plan, the regulations included in the land use plan shall prevail.\n""} 
Sec. 23-9. Use classification. The use regulations of the zoning districts are based on the following use classification system. (a) Purpose and intent. The purpose of these provisions is to classify uses of land into a number of specially defined land use categories on the basis of common functional characteristics and similar compatibility with other uses, thereby providing a basis for regulation of uses in accordance with criteria that are directly relevant to the public interest. These provisions shall apply throughout this chapter. (b) Classification of principal uses. The use categories listed on the following use regulations schedule shall be considered to be principal uses. A single lot may contain more than one principal use, unless otherwise prohibited by the provisions of this chapter. All existing and proposed uses shall be classified into the use category that most closely portrays the overall nature of such activity, consistent with the definitions of the use categories in sec. 21-9, definitions. Any use that cannot be so classified shall not be permitted in any district.\n""} ",11,codelibrary

10-5-2: PURPOSE STATEMENTS: A. Residence Districts: 1. A - Single-Family Residence District: This district is intended to provide a residential environment of larger lots with generous yards. It also establishes the standards for new single-family developments in the community. 2. R1 - Single-Family Residence District: This district is intended to provide a residential environment of moderate sized lots which still provide for generous yards. 3. R2 - Single-Family Residence District: This district is intended to provide a residential environment of moderate sized lots with smaller yards. 4. R3 - Two-Family Residence District: This district is intended to provide a residential environment for two-family dwellings and shall be located on the fringe of single-family neighborhoods along arterial and collector streets or adjacent to the downtown area. \""Two-family units\"" may be defined either as side by side units separated by a common wall or stacked units with one unit on top of the other. 5. RB - Residential Buffer District: This district is established to provide for a mix of low density single-family and two-family uses and low density office uses which are designed as traditional, detached residential styled buildings or structures. The district shall serve as a transitional zone, which is an area, used to gradually decrease the intensity of use and to develop distance between single-family residentially zoned property and more intensive land uses and zoning districts, such as commercially zoned property. The district may or may not be appropriate in, and shall be limited to, the following locations: a. Corner lots located adjacent to and at the intersection of regional arterial streets where property zoned for residential purposes is abutted by, or across the street from, any commercial, industrial or office district; and/or b. Lots located adjacent to the C1 - village center commercial district. 6. R4 - Multi-Family Residence District: This district is intended to provide for a multiple-family residential environment of moderate density. The R4 district is intended to accommodate existing apartment buildings which have developed over time within the village. While this district will be applied to existing multi-family development built on a lot by lot basis, it is intended that new multi-family dwelling units shall be constructed as part of a planned development. (Ord. 01-2158, 1-22-2001) 7. SFA - Single-Family Attached Residence District: This district is intended to provide a residential environment for two-family and single-family attached dwellings and shall be located adjacent to the BNSF Railroad right of way east and west of the downtown area. (Ord. 03-2266, 10-27-2003) 8. R5 - Continuing Care Retirement Community Residence District: This district is intended to provide for the development of larger tracts of land that are not less than twenty (20.0) gross acres in size nor in excess of forty (40.0) gross acres in size. The intent is for such land to be developed as a continuing care retirement community (\""CCRC\"") under the village's planned development and conditional use regulations. A CCRC is a planned residential development intended for individuals sixty two (62) years of age or older or couples at least one member of which is sixty two (62) years of age or older which shall include a licensed nursing home facility as an integral part of the development and also provide facilities for varying degrees of assisted living for residents and other such accessory uses that may be appropriate for a CCRC and each of these other facilities, to the extent required by law, shall be licensed, operated and maintained in accordance with the laws and regulations of the state of Illinois. (Ord. 04-2308, 9-13-2004) B. Business Districts: 1. C1 - Village Center Commercial District: This district constitutes the town center or downtown of Western Springs and is intended to accommodate a range of compatible retail, financial, service, governmental, professional and residential uses in a setting conducive to and safe for pedestrian activity. This district is intended principally for retail commercial uses. 2. C2 - Community Shopping District: This district is intended to provide for those commercial activities that require locations along arterial or collector streets with larger lots and greater vehicular access. 3. O - Limited Office District: This district is intended to provide an environment for small office facilities that generate minimal vehicular traffic and require little visibility from the streets on which they are located. It is intended that this district be located principally to function as a buffer between commercial and residential districts. This district must be located adjacent to a commercial district. A single residential dwelling is permitted above the first floor. 4. ORI - Office Research And Limited Industrial District: This district is intended to provide an environment for light industrial uses that do not produce noise, vibration, smoke, particulate matter, fire and explosive hazards, toxic matter, odorous matter, and/or glare, or otherwise create nuisances which could impact nearby residential development. (Ord. 92-1855, 12-14-1992) 5. DT - Downtown Transitional District: This district is intended to provide a transitional zone used to gradually decrease the intensity of use and to separate single-family residentially zoned property and commercially zoned property. It provides a location for surface parking lots and potentially other compatible land uses adjacent to and serving commercial uses within the C1 - village center commercial district. (Ord. 03-2266, 10-27-2003) 6. MXD - Mixed Use Commercial-Residential District: This district is intended to provide opportunities for development of sites with new or rehabilitated buildings that contain a mix of commercial and residential uses. The first floor of such buildings should provide space for commercial, office, retail and service uses that are easily accessible to the public. First floor residential uses are permitted but should be located in areas that are secondary to the commercial spaces. The first floor of the building also should include other related ancillary services and amenities that support the building occupants, such as internal pedestrian accessways and elevator areas, storage areas, concierge or security desk, mechanical and utility rooms, restrooms, meeting rooms and common areas that serve some or all of the building uses. The properties that are eligible to be rezoned to this district are located at the southeast corner of the Burlington Avenue and Wolf Road intersection and are identified as: property index numbers 18-05-305-011, 18-05-305-028 and 18-05-305-029 (formerly the Tischler's Grocery Store site and the Breen's Drycleaner Store site); property index numbers 18-05-305-009, 18-05-305-010 and 18-05-305-023 (the Benak Auto Repair Shop site); and property index numbers: 18-05-305-026 (the Commonwealth Edison site) (see also, plan commission recommendation no. 15-01). (Ord. 15-2786, 2-23-2015) C. Special Purpose Districts: 1. Municipal And Governmental Land District: This district is intended to accommodate and regulate the use and development of land owned by the village and state, county and federal governments within the jurisdictional boundaries of the village. (Ord. 09-2552, 10-12-2009)\n""} 
10-5-3: ZONING MAP: A. Location And Boundaries: The location and boundaries of the districts established by this ordinance are set forth in the official zoning map as amended from time to time, which is incorporated herein and hereby made a part of this ordinance. The map shall be published as provided by law as a part of this ordinance, as though fully set forth and described herein. The map shall be filed with the office of the village clerk and certified copies shall be made available for public purchase and inspection from the village clerk's office during standard business hours. B. Zoning Map Interpretation: 1. Zoning district boundary lines shall be interpreted to be coterminous with centerlines of streets, alleys, expressways and railroad rights of way; section lines or division of section lines; tract or lot lines; and such lines extended, unless otherwise indicated. 2. In areas not subdivided into lots and blocks, wherever a district or portion of a district is indicated as a strip adjacent to and paralleling a street, highway, or railroad, the depth of such strips shall be in accordance with dimensions shown on the maps measured at right angles from the centerline of streets, highways, or railroad rights of way unless otherwise indicated. (Ord. 92-1855, 12-14-1992)\n""} 
10-5-4: ANNEXED LANDS:On all land annexed to the village of Western Springs after the effective date hereof, no construction or modification of land use shall occur until an ordinance designating the zoning classification of such land is duly adopted by the village of Western Springs. Within thirty (30) days of annexation, the plan commission shall file an application for an amendment to establish the zoning classification of such land. Action shall be taken by the Western Springs village board on such application within sixty (60) days of its filing. If no preannexation hearing is held and the Western Springs village board does not approve a zoning amendment to classify such land as provided for in this ordinance, such land will be classified as A - single-family residence district, until such time as an amendment changing the zoning classification is adopted.

9-2-2: INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT SEQUENCE: A. General Rule: This zoning code rejects as outdated and inappropriate the concept of hierarchical and cumulative zoning districts and, except as noted below, is based on the concept that each district should be designed to accomplish a specific purpose, to encourage a particular type of development, and to protect that development from being encroached upon by incompatible types of development. B. Special Rule: Within the foregoing philosophy, however, it is recognized that when different districts are juxtaposed, their differing characters may require special treatment to ameliorate incompatibilities that might otherwise result. For this limited purpose, this zoning code recognizes the concept of \""more restrictive\"" and \""less restrictive\"" districts. And for this limited purpose, the districts established by this zoning code shall be considered \""more restrictive\"" or \""less restrictive\"" in accordance with the following rules: 1. The open space district shall be deemed to be more restrictive than any other district. 2. The residential districts shall be deemed to be more restrictive than any nonresidential district except the open space district. 3. The R-1/2 district shall be deemed to be the most restrictive residential district and the R-6 district shall be deemed to be the least restrictive residential district, and the residential districts shall be deemed to become less restrictive as the district number increases. 4. The institutional buildings district shall be deemed to be more restrictive than the business and office districts but less restrictive than any residential district. 5. The business and office districts shall be deemed to be more restrictive than the industrial districts, and all of them shall be deemed to become less restrictive as the district number increases. 6. Except in the DR downtown redevelopment overlay district, overlay districts shall not be considered in determining the restrictiveness of the underlying district. (Ord., 10-2004)\n""} 
9-2-3: ANNEXED LAND: A. Annexation Of Land: All land annexed to the village after the effective date of this zoning code shall be classified automatically after such annexation in the R-1/2 single-family residential district. The owner of any land proposed to be annexed to the village shall file, with the petition for annexation, an application for a certificate of zoning compliance pursuant to chapter 13 of this title. In the case of an involuntary annexation, the village manager shall complete the required application. B. Application For Different Classification: When any land is classified pursuant to this section, it shall remain so classified unless and until an application to amend such classification is filed and granted pursuant to section 9-14-1 and chapter 18 of this title. Such application may be filed prior to or contemporaneously with the annexation of the land in question. (Ord., 10-2004)\n""} 
9-2-4: ZONING MAP: A. Map Incorporated: The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this zoning code are as shown on a map titled \""zoning map of the village of Lake Zurich, Illinois\"", hereafter referred to as the zoning map, which is by this reference incorporated as part of this zoning code. All notations, references, and other information shown on the zoning map, and all amendments to it, shall be as much a part of this zoning code as if specifically set forth and literally described herein. B. Omitted Land: It is the intent of this zoning code that the entire area of the village, including all land and water areas, be included in the districts established by this zoning code. Any area lying within the village but not shown on the zoning map as being included in such a district shall be deemed to be, and it is hereby, classified in the R-1/2 single-family residential district. C. District Boundaries: In the event that any uncertainty exists with respect to the intended boundaries of the various districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 1. The district boundaries are the centerlines of expressways, highways, streets, alleys, waterways, railroads, and other rights of way unless otherwise indicated. When the designation of a boundary line on the zoning map coincides with the location of any such right of way, then the centerline of that right of way shall be construed to be the boundary of such district. 2. When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the centerline of any right of way but does coincide with a lot line, then that lot line shall be construed to be the boundary of such district. 3. When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the centerline of any right of way or with a lot line, then the district boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning map. D. Maintenance And Availability Of Zoning Map: The official copy of the zoning map shall be maintained by the village manager and shall be available for public inspection during village business hours at the village hall. Any amendment to zoning district boundaries or any change in any other information shown on the zoning map made by amendment to this zoning code shall be indicated on the official copy of the zoning map.

9-2-5: OFFICIAL COMPREHENSIVE PLAN: A. Definition: The \""official comprehensive plan\"" of the village shall be defined as a compilation of policy statements; goals; standards; maps; recommended planning, regulatory, fiscal, and public works programs; pertinent data relative to the past, present, and future trends of the village with respect to its population, housing, economic, social, and environmental development patterns and its land, water, and natural resources and use and its transportation facilities, public facilities, and utilities; and any other matter relative to the present and future patterns of life within the village or within the unincorporated areas lying within one and one-half (11/2) miles of its boundaries as they may from time to time exist, prepared and recommended by the plan commission with the advice and assistance of the village manager and the village manager's staff and adopted by the board of trustees by ordinance duly enacted, together with such amendments thereto as may be adopted from time to time. The term \""official comprehensive plan\"" also shall refer to any internally consistent and complete portion of such a compilation relating to any one or more of the aforesaid subjects or to any specific portion of the aforesaid geographical area. As of the effective date of this zoning code, the term \""official comprehensive plan\"" shall be understood to refer to the following documents: 1. The Lake Zurich 2003 comprehensive land use plan. 2. This zoning code. 3. The Lake Zurich land development code, as amended, set forth in title 10 of the Lake Zurich municipal code. 4. Sections 3, 4, and 5 of the \""Transportation Plan And Redevelopment Strategy For The Village Center\"", prepared by Trkla, Pettigrew, Allen & Payne, Inc., related to potential redevelopment of downtown Lake Zurich. B. Purpose: The official comprehensive plan shall be considered an official statement of the policy of the village with respect to the existing and developing character of the various areas of the village and its vicinity; the proper objectives, standards, and direction for future maintenance, growth, development, and redevelopment of the village; the means to be employed to protect existing character or development and to encourage future development that will be in the best interests of the village; and the actions and programs to be undertaken by the village with respect to its future maintenance and development. C. Effect: After the adoption of the official comprehensive plan or a part thereof, no ordinance, regulation, or official map relating to the physical maintenance, development, or redevelopment of the village or any land within it shall be enacted, established, amended, or varied and no right of way, street, utility, or public structure or land shall be authorized, established, developed, redeveloped, or modified in location or extent except in accordance with the policies, goals, objectives, principles, and standards of the official comprehensive plan or relevant part thereof unless the board of trustees shall first make a specific finding that the facts and circumstances affecting the particular matter justify a departure from the official comprehensive plan. D. Procedures: 1. Plan Development: The plan commission, with the assistance of the village manager and the village manager's staff, shall oversee the continuing development and revision of the official comprehensive plan. The plan commission and the village manager, in developing a plan, shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain the views, comments, and criticisms of interested persons. In addition, the plan commission, prior to making any recommendation for the adoption or amendment of a plan or part thereof to the board of trustees, shall set, notice, and conduct a public hearing thereon in accordance with the provisions of section 9-14-3 of this title.The board of trustees, at any time, may refer a plan to the plan commission for consideration and recommendation. In the case of such referral, the plan commission shall return its recommendation to the board of trustees not later than ninety (90) days after the receipt of the referral. If such recommendation is not so delivered, then the board of trustees may proceed to consider the amendment without such recommendation.When satisfied that a plan or a part thereof is adequate for adoption as, or as an amendment of, the official comprehensive plan of the village or a part thereof, the plan commission shall transmit such plan or part thereof to the board of trustees together with its recommendations for adoption of such plan as well as any reports or statements deemed necessary to a full consideration of such plan or part thereof. Such reports or statements may include majority and minority positions. Such transmittal shall be made not later than fifteen (15) days after the close of the public hearing concerning such plan. 2. Plan Adoption: After receiving any recommendation of the plan commission with respect to the adoption or amendment of any plan or a part thereof, the board of trustees, by ordinance duly enacted, may adopt such plan in whole or in part, with or without amendments; or may refer such plan or any part thereof back to the plan commission for further consideration; or may reject such plan. The board of trustees shall take such action not later than ninety (90) days after the close of the plan commission public hearing on such plan. The failure of the board of trustees to act within such period shall be deemed to be a rejection of the plan. Upon the adoption of any such plan or part thereof, it shall be designated as the \""official comprehensive plan of the village of Lake Zurich\"" and, if less than a total comprehensive plan, shall carry a subheading designating its specific contents. 3. Plan Amendment: The official comprehensive plan, or any part thereof, may be amended at any time in accordance with the provisions of this subsection D3. Such an amendment may be initiated by the board of trustees, the plan commission, the village manager, or by any owner of property affected by the provisions of such plan sought to be amended. Amendments initiated by the board of trustees, the plan commission, or the village manager shall require no formal application and shall be processed as provided in subsections D1 and D2 of this section. Amendments initiated by the owner of affected property shall be initiated by an application filed pursuant to section 9-14-1 of this title, except that the time limits specified in subsections D1 and D2 of this section shall apply. 4.
