[Ord. No. 2006-1034 § 1; Ord. No. 2006-1047 § 1]
The purpose of the VR zone is to ensure that any new developmentis consistent with the character and scale of Neshanic Station.
As the village has grown and changed over time, parcels of varioussizes have been created, with some smaller and some larger. However,prior VR zone standards have encouraged further subdivision and deconstructionor substantial alteration of the fabric and scenic character of thevillage. Stately older homes on "oversized" parcels are a key elementof village character that should not be left on undignified remnantparcels with large new modern homes and cul-de-sacs erasing the contextof an earlier era and an important element of village character. Thedensity, bulk and design review standards are intended to preserve,protect and enhance the village character to the greatest extent practicable.
