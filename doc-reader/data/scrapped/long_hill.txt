[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 12-6.1      Purpose.

[[CONTENT]]
[Ord. No. 252-09 § 1; Ord. No. 266-10 § 3]
The purpose of this section is to regulate the outdoor applicationof fertilizer so as to reduce the overall amount of excess nutrientsentering waterways, thereby helping to protect and improve surfacewater quality. This section does not apply to fertilizer applicationon commercial farms.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 12-6.2      Basis and Background.

[[CONTENT]]
[Ord. No. 252-09 § 1; Ord. No. 266-10 § 3]
Elevated levels of nutrients, particularly phosphorus, in surfacewaterbodies can result in excessive and accelerated growth of algaeand aquatic plants (eutrophication). Excessive plant growth can resultin diurnal variations and extremes in dissolved oxygen and pH, which,in turn, can be detrimental to aquatic life. As algae and plant materialsdie off, the decay process creates a further demand on dissolved oxygenlevels. The presence of excessive plant matter can also restrict useof the affected water for recreation and water supply. While healthyvegetated areas are protective of water quality by stabilizing soiland filtering precipitation, when fertilizers are applied to the landsurface improperly or in excess of the needs of target vegetation,nutrients can be transported by means of stormwater to nearby waterways,contributing to the problematic growth of excessive aquatic vegetation.
Most soils in New Jersey contain sufficient amounts of phosphorusto support adequate root growth for established turf. Over time, itis necessary to replenish available phosphorus, but generally notat the levels commonly applied. Other target vegetation, such as vegetablegardens and agricultural/horticultural plantings, will have a greaterneed for phosphorus application, as will the repair or establishmentof new lawns or cover vegetation. A soils test and fertilizer applicationrecommendation geared to the soil and planting type is the best meansto determine the amount of nutrients to apply. Timing and placementof fertilizer application is also critical to avoid transport of nutrientsto waterways through stormwater runoff. Fertilizer applied immediatelyprior to a runoff-producing rainfall, outside the growing season orto impervious surfaces is most likely to be carried away by meansof runoff without accomplishing the desired objective of supportingtarget vegetation growth. Therefore, the management of the type, amountand techniques for fertilizer application is necessary as one toolto protect water resources. This section does not apply to applicationof fertilizer on commercial farms, but improper application of fertilizeron farms would be problematic as well. Stewardship on the part ofcommercial farmers is needed to address this potential source of excessnutrient load to waterbodies. Commercial farmers are expected to implementbest management practices in accordance with conservation managementplans or resource conservation plans developed for the farm by the
Natural Resource Conservation Service and approved by the Soil Conservation

§ LU-145.2      Sediment Control.

[[CONTENT]]
a. Development Applications. No application for the approval of anyproject shall be granted unless and until a soil erosion and sedimentcontrol plan shall have been submitted to and approved by the approvingauthority.
b. Other Activity.
1. In situations where no project approval is required, it shall beunlawful for any person to create or cause any land disturbance whichposes the risk of, or which may reasonably be anticipated to resultin, material, substantial, harmful or otherwise detrimental soil erosionor sedimentation of or to any land or watercourse unless and untila soil erosion and sediment control plan shall have been submittedto and approved by the Planning Board.
2. Such review and approval shall be made within a period of 30 daysof the submission of a complete application unless, by mutual agreementin writing between the Township and the applicant, this period isextended for an additional 30 days. Failure of the Township to makea decision within such period or such extension thereof shall constitutecertification.
3. The applicant shall be provided with written notice of such decisionby the Township Engineer. A copy of such decision including the nameof the applicant, the site location by street address and block andlot number and the proposed land use shall be sent to the Morris County
Soil Conservation District. The Township shall also make availablesuch other information as may be required by the District.
c. Principles and Standards.
1. The soil erosion and sediment control plan shall be comprised ofa map and written report, together with whatever other instruments,writings, drawings, plans or specifications are necessary or appropriateunder the circumstances, which fully and adequately describe bothtemporary and permanent measures to be employed to control, minimizeand protect against soil erosion and sedimentation from a proposedland disturbance, taking into account the particular nature and characteristicsof the land, the surrounding area, the watercourses, the land disturbanceand the planned development involved. The plan shall cover all stagesand aspects of the proposed land disturbance and planned developmentfrom grading, stripping, excavation and other site preparation throughand including both final grading and the installation of permanentimprovements. It shall accordingly include a timing schedule or schedulesindicating both of the following:
(a)
The anticipated starting and completion dates of each step inthe land disturbance and development sequence and the time of exposureof each land area prior to the completion of effective erosion andsediment control measures.
(b)
The sequence of installation of planned erosion and sediment control measures as related to the disturbance and development sequence referred to in Subsection (a) above, including anticipated starting and completion dates of such installations.
2. Soil erosion and sediment control measures may, as a minimum, utilizeand meet the Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New
Jersey, as promulgated by the State Soil Conservation Committee andas the same may hereafter be amended and supplemented.
In addition, the following general conditions shall be met bythe applicant:
(a)
It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to design theproject in accordance with standards set by the approving authorityto maintain as nearly as possible the predevelopment state and conditionof any stream, watercourse, swale, floodplain, wetland, pond, lakeor existing maintenance facility.
(b)
It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to promptlyremove sediment resulting from the applicant's project from any streamor watercourse, pond, lake or drainage facility.
3. In addition, the following measures or considerations shall be incorporatedin the soil erosion and sediment control plan:
(a)
The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at anyone time during development, and the duration of such exposure shallbe kept to a practical minimum. If disturbance is within 250 feetof steep slopes, a waterway, wetlands or similar critical areas, the
Planning Board may require a special timetable for construction including,for example, certified completion of roadways and utilities beforebeginning site-by-site construction on individual lots.
(b)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation and the natural groundsurface shall be retained and protected.
(c)
Temporary vegetative protection plant cover and/or mulchingshall be used to protect erosion areas during development.
(d)
Diversions and outlets, both temporary and permanent, shallbe constructed and/or installed to accommodate the increased runoffcaused by the changed soil and surface conditions during and afterdevelopment.
(e)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(f)
Until the disturbed area is stabilized, sediment in the runoffwater shall be trapped and removed to the maximum extent feasibleby the use of debris basins, sediment basins, desilting basins, silttraps or other acceptable methods.
(g)
Whenever feasible, development shall preserve salient naturalfeatures and existing grades, thereby keeping grading, stripping andexcavation to a minimum.
(h)
Adequate provisions shall be made to minimize the damaging ofslopes and embankments by surface water. Cutoff ditches or diversionsmay be utilized for this purpose.
(i)
Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize slidingor erosion and shall not encroach on watercourses.
(j)
Fill placed adjacent to a watercourse shall have suitable protectionagainst erosion for all weather stream flow conditions and particularlyduring periods of flooding.
(k)
During grading operations, methods for dust control will beexercised.
(l)
During grading, excavation and other construction activities,slopes and embankments shall be stabilized by mulching with strawsprayed with an asphalt mixture, jute matting staked in position,a seeding of annual rye grass or other acceptable method.
(m)
Permanent (final) vegetative protection, plant cover, lawn orground cover and mechanical erosion control devices and measures shallbe installed or constructed and completed as soon as practicably possible.
(n)
Permanent improvements, such as roads, catch basins, curbs andthe like, shall be installed or constructed and completed as soonas practicably possible.
d. Implementation.
1. In considering and approving a soil erosion and sediment controlplan, the approving authority:
(a)
Shall have the right, among other things, to fix the time schedulefor exposure of land areas and for the construction and installationof improvements, or the taking of other measures, to prevent soilerosion and sedimentation, and may require that such work or measuresbe completed prior to any site development work.
(b)
Shall provide for the posting of performance guaranties andmaintenance bonds in the same manner as provided in this Ordinance.
(c)
May refer the plan to the Soil Conservation District and/orto any other qualified governmental agency or agencies for reviewand shall take no action on the plan before the expiration of a periodof 30 days within which the Soil Conservation District or other governmentalagencies may submit a report or until after the report is received,whichever is sooner.
(d)
May impose lawful conditions or requirements necessary or desirablefor proper implementation of the plan and of the purpose and intentof this section.
2. After a soil erosion and sediment control plan has been approved,it shall be unlawful for the applicant therefor, or any person performingservices in implementing the plan, knowingly to deviate from, change,amend or modify the plan in any way, except in accordance with theprovisions of Subsection 3 below.
(a)
Minor changes, amendments or modifications to a soil erosionand sediment control plan required as a result of conditions in thefield during construction may be approved by the Township Engineerwho shall, in turn, notify the approving authority thereof. Majorchanges, amendments or modifications to such a plan shall requirethe approval of the approving authority.
e. Maintenance. Any person carrying out soil erosion and sediment controlmeasures under this section, and all subsequent owners of the propertyupon which such measures have been carried out, shall adequately maintainall permanent control measures, devices and plantings in good orderfor a period of two years after completion of the approval plan implementationor until such measures are permanently stabilized as determined bythe Township Engineer, whichever occurs sooner. Maintenance bondstherefor shall be posted in connection therewith as provided for inthis section.
f. Enforcement.
1. No approval of occupancy of any building shall be granted unlessall measures required under the soil erosion and sediment controlplan have been completed in accordance with this section. A formalreport of compliance with the provisions of the approved soil erosionand sediment control plan shall be filed with the Construction Official.
A copy of the report shall be sent to the Morris County Soil Conservation
District. Approval for occupancy may be granted notwithstanding thatpermanent (final) vegetative protection, plant cover or lawn or groundcover has not been installed if such permanent protection and coverhas not and cannot be installed because of conditions of weather,and the installation thereof is enforced by appropriate provisionsin the bond or other security and improvement agreements which shallprovide for installation within such time limits as may be reasonableupon direction of the Township Engineer, as soon as weather conditionsshall permit. If permanent protection and cover has not and cannotbe installed, temporary measures, in accordance with the Standardsfor Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, as promulgatedby the State Soil Conservation Committee, must be installed untilsuch time as permanent measures can be installed in accordance withthe bond and agreement.
2. The applicant shall be required to have the approved or certifiedsoil erosion and sediment control plan on site during construction.
3. The Township Engineer shall enforce the requirements of this sectionand shall inspect the work being undertaken in connection with a plan.
In the event of a failure to comply with any condition or thing inthe plan, the Township Engineer may issue stop orders and generallytake such action as may be justified under the circumstances, includinga recommendation to the Construction Official to revoke the buildingpermit or certificate of occupancy.
g. Fees.
1. Prior to the commencement of the construction of improvements orof any other work to be done in accordance with the terms and provisionsof this section and the soil erosion and sediment control plan, aninspection fee shall be paid to the Township. The inspection fee shallbe based upon an hourly rate schedule for various Township employeeswho will, or may, perform inspection services, said schedule to beas established and amended from time to time by resolution of the
Township Committee, and an estimate by the Township Engineer of thetotal inspection costs based upon the rate schedule and the anticipatedinspection services.
2. Should the total inspection fee paid hereunder be greater than theactual inspection cost, the difference shall be refunded to the applicantafter all inspections are completed.
3. Should the total inspection cost be greater than the inspection feepaid hereunder, the difference shall be paid to the Township priorto the release of any performance guaranties.

§ LU-146.3      Design Standards.

[[CONTENT]]
[2-24-2021 by Ord. No.
469-21]
a. Major Developments. All major developments shall have their stormwatermanagement designed in accordance with the Residential Site Improvement
Standards (RSIS, N.J.A.C. 5:21) and the NJDEP Stormwater Rule (N.J.A.C.
7:8) to include green infrastructure as outlined in N.J.A.C. 7:8.
These standards shall apply to all projects, residential and nonresidentialas well as projects by the Township, Board of Education and otheragencies subject to review by the Township.
b. Minor developments shall be designed to include the following stormwatermanagement measures where applicable:
1. Seepage pits or other infiltration measures shall be provided witha capacity of four inches of runoff for each square foot of increasedimpervious area.
2. When the approving agency finds that the existing conditions arenot conducive to infiltration, the applicant may provide other stormwatermanagement facilities as to result in a zero net runoff as calculatedby the Modified Rational Method.
3. When the ground surface is changed in character such that an increasein runoff results, but the new surface is not impervious, seepagepits or other stormwater management facilities shall be provided toresult in a zero net runoff rate as calculated by the Modified Rational
Method.
c. Drywell Design: Stone used in the infiltration devices shall be 2 1/2
inches clean stone and design void ratio of 33% shall be used. Theinfiltration measures shall be designed with an overflow to the surfacewhich shall be stabilized and directed to an existing stormwater conveyancesystem or in a manner to keep the overflow on the developed propertyto the greatest extent feasible. If the new impervious surface isnot roof area, an equivalent area of existing roof may be directedto the infiltration system. This shall be permitted where the existingroof is not already directed to infiltration devices. The infiltrationof water during the rainfall event shall not be counted as a "credit"
toward the storage requirement.
d. Soil erosion and sediment control measures shall be installed inaccordance with the Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Controlin New Jersey.
e. For the purposes of this section, gravel areas that are subject tocompaction (such as driveways, parking areas and walking paths) shallbe considered impervious. Pool surface areas, patios and decks shallbe considered impervious. Gravel areas not subject to compaction (suchas decorative stone used in planting beds) shall be considered pervious.
f. All roof gutters shall be protected from the accumulation of leavesand litter by the installation of a gutter cap leaf separation devicewithin the project area. Gutter screens or louvers are not acceptable.

124.12, and complies with the design standards herein specified.
(d)
The need for additional public open space or recreational facilitiesin the area.
(e)
The potential for an open space connection between two publicopen space areas.
(f)
The desirability of public access due to the peculiar physicalcharacteristics of the area which make it suitable for public openspace uses not otherwise available in that area.
(g)
Whether the proposed common open space area is suitable forrecreational or open space uses.
3. The approving authority shall not be compelled to approve a proposalfor a density modification subdivision if it determines that the proposaldoes not further the orderly development of the area and the proposedopen space does not relate to the Master Plan for development of the
Township.
c. Density modification subdivisions shall be subject to the followingadditional design standards:
1. House lots and common open space shall be so arranged as to discouragefuture development of the common open space for other than open spaceuses.
2. The maximum number of house lots shall abut the common open spaceand all house lots shall have reasonable access to the common openspace.
3. The location and arrangement of common open space shall be determinedwith due regard for area topography, preservation of landscape, appropriatesiting of lots, relationship of open space to surrounding development,access by persons and maintenance equipment and other applicable factors,as determined by the approving authority.
4. Wherever possible, common open space shall abut park land or otherland in public ownership so as to create large contiguous tracts ofopen space.
5. Where feasible, separate vehicular and pedestrian circulation systemsshall be provided.
6. Where practicable, house lots in the density modification subdivisionshall be located and sized so as to avoid abrupt changes in lot sizes,setbacks or the like between the density modification subdivisionand abutting existing developments.
7. All common open space shown on a preliminary plat shall be includedin the first section submitted for final plat approval. However, inthe case of a subdivision to be developed over a period of years,the approving authority may permit the total area proposed for commonopen space to be divided among the sections as submitted for finalplat approval, in which case the common open space appurtenant toeach such section shall comply with the minimum common open spacerequirements as applied to each section.

The "safety and stabilization guarantee" shall be reduced by the same percentage as the performance guarantee is being reduced at the time of each performance guarantee reduction.
For the purpose of releasing the obligor from liability pursuant to its performance guarantee, the amount of the performance guarantee attributable to each approved bonded improvement shall be reduced by the total amount for each such improvement, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the Township Engineer and appended to the performance guarantee pursuant to Subsection a of this section, including any contingency factor applied to the cost of installation. If the sum of the approved bonded improvements would exceed 70% of the total amount of the performance guarantee, then the Township may retain 30% of the amount of the total performance guarantee and "safety and stabilization guarantee" to ensure completion and acceptability of bonded improvements, as provided above, except that any amount of the performance guarantee attributable to bonded improvements for which a "temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee" has been posted shall be released from the performance guarantee even if such release would reduce the amount held by the Township below 30%.
