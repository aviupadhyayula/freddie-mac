§ LDO5-8.4      Design Standards for the R/S-1 and R/S-2 Retail Service Zones and the PO Planned Overlay Zone.

[[CONTENT]]
[Ord. No. 2006-1033 § 2; Ord. No. 2006-1046 § 2;
Ord. No. 2015-1263 §§ 4 —6]
A. Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to:
1.
Provide the development community in Branchburg with the designexpectations for commercial projects in addition to streamlining thereview process, resulting in a quality building and site design.
2.
Assure consistent application of overall design objectives.
3.
Protect the Township by encouraging high quality development.
4.
Enhance the local sense of community.
5.
Advance accessible developments.
6.
Minimize heat islands by incorporating large shade trees intosite design and larger interior landscape areas within parking lots.
7.
Promote individual site design accents such as water features,art areas, landscape, public spaces and plazas.
B. Applicability. The standards in this subsection shall be used inthe design of structures and site layout for all development and redevelopmentin the R/S-1, R/S-2, and PO zones. These standards shall be used byapplicants in preparing development plans and by the Board in reviewingthe same. In reviewing a development plan, the Board shall determinewhether or not, and to what degree, an application for developmentmeets such standards. The Board may approve, conditionally approve,modify, or deny an application for development based upon its reviewof the development plan.
C. Use of design standards. These standards identify the minimum standardsfor the design of development in the R/S-1, R/S-2, and PO zones. Whilewaiver of strict application of these standards may be appropriateto achieve design objectives, each application for development shallincorporate these guidelines to the fullest extent possible.
D. Relationship to zoning regulations. The approval process shall beguided by the zoning regulations in determining permitted uses andthese standards for building and site design. The zoning regulationslist specific area, yard and bulk development requirements, whilethese standards set the minimum criteria for quality development.
E. Site layout and building orientation.
1.
The orientation of a building strongly influences a site's focusof activity. A building oriented at least in part to an adjoiningpublic street can create a strong presence in the public realm, definingthe edge of the built environment. On the other hand, street frontageinterrupted by long stretches of parking lot asphalt or other "emptyspaces" can detract from a positive visual image. These standardsencourage the creation of a continuous, defined street edge, whethercomprised of building, walls, or vegetation.
2.
Particular attention shall be paid to building orientation inrelation to surrounding uses, including screening of loading, utilityservice and trash receptacle areas. In addition, types of signage,lighting and landscape materials shall be incorporated to minimizeimpact on other properties.
F. Compatibility with residential zones.
1.
Development adjoining residential zones shall incorporate lowerscale, single story elements and/or greater setbacks adjacent to residentialzones.
2.
Accessory or utility uses shall be at least 25 feet away fromany residential use or zone.
3.
Building walls facing residential zones shall incorporate thesame design and building materials as used on the principal facadeof the building.
4.
Drive-in lanes shall be located away from adjacent residentialzones. Menu boards shall not be visible from residential zones. Speakersshall not create sound audible from residential zones.
5.
A vegetative buffer along with fencing and/or masonry screening shall be included where adjacent to residential zones as required in Section 4-5.4.
G. Building placement.
1.
Buildings shall be located as close as possible to the intersectionsof arterial streets. Structures located close to intersections providea strong visual and pedestrian relationship to the street while takinginto account the queuing requirements for any drive-through services.
Parking and store entrances along with associated services may belocated behind the structures.
2.
Gas canopies, drive-through lanes, service functions and accessorystructures shall be located away from intersections.
3.
In a development incorporating multiple buildings, the siteshall be organized so that the site layout encourages functional pedestrianspaces and connections between and in front of the buildings.
4.
Weather and sun protection for outdoor areas, such as overhangs,awnings, canopies or landscaped shade areas shall be provided to mitigateclimatic effects.
H. Site layout and building orientation at street intersections. Majorintersections of commercial activity need special attention so thatall four corners are linked and function as a whole, and so that aunique sense of place and "arrival" is maintained or created. A developmentlocated at the intersections of two arterial streets shall complywith the following site layout and building orientation standards:
1.
Parking areas and drive-through facilities shall not be locatedwithin a 150-foot radius measured from the intersection of the centerlines of the two arterial streets.
2.
Development located within a 150-foot radius from the intersectionof the center lines of the two arterial streets shall include twoor more of the following focal point features, which shall be visiblefrom the intersection:
(a)
A distinctive design that does not represent standard franchisearchitecture;
(b)
A vertical architectural feature or appendage that is a minimumof 45 feet tall (e.g., a clock tower, spire, or interesting roof form);
(c)
Exceptional landscape feature.
Figure 1 - Development located within a 150-foot radius fromthe intersection of the center lines of the 2 arterial streets shallinclude 2 or more focal point features visible from the intersectingstreets.
I. Orientation of entry facades. Entry facades shall orient towardsthe primary street or the active pedestrian zone within the site tocreate an inviting image, and a clear front and street edge definition.
J. Multiple-building developments/pad sites.
1.
Intent. The siting and design of smaller retail stores, or "pads,"
can create an inviting appearance in a larger, multiple-building developmentby reducing a project's scale and expanding the range of activitiesand businesses found within a single development. Adding pad sitesto a commercial center can help to improve the development's visualinterest by framing entries and placing storefront spaces closer tothe street to create a more active street scene. The siting and orientationof these smaller stores shall create spaces that relate to both theprimary buildings and the street frontage and shall be architecturallycompatible with the primary or anchor buildings of the development.
2.
Design guidelines and standards.
(a)
General guideline. The number, location, and design of independentpad sites shall reinforce, rather than obscure, the identity and functionof a development, especially in large commercial centers.
(b)
Clustering of pad sites. To the maximum extent practicable,pad sites shall be clustered together to define street edges and entrypoints or to enclose and create interesting places between buildings.
Dispersal of pad sites in a widely-spaced pattern within the development,even if along street edges, is discouraged.
(c)
Spaces between adjacent pad sites. To the maximum extent practicable,spaces between adjacent pad site buildings shall be improved to providesmall pockets (preferably heavily landscaped) of customer parking,pedestrian connections, small-scale project amenities, or focal points.
Examples include:
(1) Landscaped pedestrian ways linking customer entrancesbetween two or more pad site buildings;
(2) Public seating or outdoor eating areas;
(3) Areas landscaped with living materials emphasizingfour- season colors, textures, and varieties;
(4) Sculptures and fountains.
(d)
Pad site building design.
(1) Pad site buildings shall incorporate the same materialsand colors as those on the primary commercial building(s) in the development.
(2) Significant departures from "off-the-shelf" standardizedfranchise building design may be required to meet this standard.
(3) Pad site entrances are appropriate locations toexpress individual building character or identity. Customer entrancesshall be emphasized through incorporation of building recesses, projections,canopies, or similar design elements.
(4) The design of any pad site shall comply with therequirements of this subsection.
K. Relationship to surrounding development; operational compatibility.
1.
Intent. Because the Township's commercial zones and land usesare adjacent to or in relatively close proximity to residential zones,ensuring that commercial projects relate well to surrounding developmentis essential. Development shall respect adjacent residential zonesand surrounding neighborhoods by ensuring that intensive operations,such as loading areas, do not adversely impact neighbors.
2.
Design guidelines and standards. The Board may impose conditionsto ensure compatibility with existing neighborhoods and uses, including,but not limited to, conditions on the following:
(a)
Location on a site of activities that generate potential adverseimpacts on adjacent uses such as noise and glare;
(b)
Placement of trash receptacles;
(c)
Location of delivery and loading zones.
Figure 2 - Development shall respect adjacent residential usesand surrounding neighborhoods by locating intensive operations, suchas loading areas, so as not to adversely impact neighbors.

R. Building design.
1.
Building height/scale/massing/form.
(a)
Intent. Building design that creates or adds to the visual interestof a streetscape and a pedestrian scale is an essential element ofthe design objectives. Building height, scale, and massing can beused to emphasize important corners, designate points of entry, andcreate a visible roofline silhouette. The primary mass of structuresshall include secondary projections that reduce the apparent scale,create visual interest, and promote compatibility with adjacent uses.
Building design shall be compatible with adjacent development.
(b)
Design guidelines and standards.
(1) Compatibility with surrounding development. Projectsin existing developed areas shall provide traditional architecturalstyling and shall be designed to compliment the traditional stylingof adjacent developments, which is encouraged by these standards.
(2) Transition to adjacent residential zones. Wherebuildings are adjacent to residential zones, building massing shallcreate a transition from the edges of a development inward. To achievethis effect, smaller and lower building mass shall be located nearedges of the development where adjacent buildings are smaller or residentialin scale.
(3) Building facade treatment. Building walls shallhave architectural interest and variety to avoid the effect of a single,long or massive wall with no relation to human scale. Building designshall be consistent with the following standards:
[a] Minimum wall articulation. There shall be no blankunarticulated building walls exceeding 30 feet in length. All buildingwalls shall be designed to meet all the following standards:
[1] All building walls shall consist of a buildingbay or structural building system that is a maximum of 30 feet inwidth. Bays shall be visually established by architectural featuressuch as columns, ribs or pilasters, piers, changes in wall planes,changes in texture or materials, and fenestration pattern no lessthan 12 inches in width.
Figure 4 - Each building facade shall incorporate wall planeprojections or recesses having a depth of at least 3% of the lengthof the facade and extending at least 20% of the length of the facade.
[2] All building walls shall include materials anddesign characteristics consistent with those on the front.
[3] Any wall exceeding 30 feet in length shall includeat least one change in wall plane, such as projections or recesses,having a depth of at least 3% of the entire length of the facade andextending at least 20% of the entire length of the facade.
[4] The above standards may be waived if the applicantcan demonstrate an alternative building design that significantlyarticulates a wall plane.
[b] Building walls facing public areas. In additionto the above, walls that face public streets, connecting walkways,or adjacent development shall meet the following standards:
[1] Facades shall be subdivided and proportioned usingfeatures such as windows, entrances, arcades, arbors, awnings, trelliseswith vines, or alternate architectural detail that defines human scale,along no less than 60% of the facade. A minimum of 10% of the entiresuch facade area shall be composed of transparent materials, unlessthe Board finds that such transparency would be inconsistent withthe operational requirements of the building. At least 1/2 of thisamount shall be provided so that the lowest edge of the transparentmaterial is no higher than four feet above the finished floor elevation.
(4) Multi-story buildings-base and top treatments.
The following standards shall apply to buildings greater than twostories:
[a] The composition of a building shall present a clearlyrecognizable base, middle, and top, or a clearly defined alternativebuilding composition.
[b] A recognizable "base" may consist of, but is notlimited to:
[1] Thicker walls, ledges, or sills;
[2] Integrally textured materials such as stone orother masonry;
[3] Integrally colored and patterned materials suchas smooth-finished stone or tile;
[4] Lighter or darker colored materials, mullions,or panels; or
[5] Planters.
[c] A recognizable "top" may consist of, but is notlimited to:
[1] Cornice treatments, other than just colored "stripes"
or "bands," with integrally textured materials such as stone or othermasonry or differently colored materials;
[2] Sloping roof with overhangs and brackets; or
[3] Stepped parapets.
2.
Consistency of style. Building design shall provide a distinctivequality, consistent, architectural character and style, that avoidsmonotones and featureless building massing and design.
Figure 5 - A consistent architectural style or theme shall beused throughout a development.
3.
Architectural detail: facades, entrances, roofs, awnings.
(a)
Intent. Doors, storefront windows, and awnings are examplesof building features that add to the character of the streetscapeand contribute to a pedestrian-oriented character of places. Theseelements shall be used to both improve the visual interest of infill/redevelopmentprojects and add to a visually unified appearance.
(b)
Design guidelines and standards.
(1) Architectural compatibility with historic buildingsand areas. New development shall be designed to respect the scaleand style of nearby historic structures, and shall employ traditionalarchitectural facades that compliment the Township's historic character.

The visual impact of a building dependsnot only on its size but also on the relationship between its length,width and height. Also, such features as prominent entries, windows,color and materials are factors in the visual impression of a building.
(1) Horizontal articulation. For a building facadeextending a distance greater than three times its average height,a perpendicular offset of at least 15% of such height is suggested.
This offset shall extend laterally for a distance equal to at least
25% of the maximum length of either adjacent wall.
(2) Alternative building articulation. So that someflexibility in creating building articulation can be accomplished,as an alternative, an applicant may elect to have offsets, set backheights and roofs with regular width or varied surfaces. Complianceachieved through this method is subject to the approval of the Board.
(3) For all buildings at least two of these elementsshall repeat horizontally. Buildings with facades greater than 100
feet in length shall include several of the elements listed below,repeated at appropriate intervals, either horizontally or vertically:
[a] Color change, recognizable but not a strong contrast;
[b] Textural change;
[c] Material change;

(b)
Design guidelines and standards.
(1) Site landscaping shall include plants similar inform and scale to existing vegetation in the neighborhood or area.
(2) Each area required to be landscaped shall be coveredin live material. Live material includes trees, shrubs, ground cover,and sod. Areas not covered in live material shall not exceed 20% andmay be covered by woody mulch, other organic or inorganic mulch, orother natural materials other than exposed gravel and aggregate rock.
2.
Site perimeter landscaping abutting street edges.
(a)
Intent. The consistent use of plantings along street edges providesa visual cohesion along streets and helps buffer automobile traffic.
The intent of these standards is to provide an attractive, shadedenvironment along street edges that gives visual relief from continuoushard street edges, focuses views for both pedestrians and motorists,and increases the sense of neighborhood scale and character.
(b)
Design guidelines and standards, street edge landscaping. Subjectto approval of the Board, along public streets, one street tree shallbe planted every 40 linear feet within the tree lawn between the sidewalkand street edge.
3.
Parking lot landscaping.
(a)
Intent. Parking lot landscaping shall be used to minimize theexpansive appearance of parking lots, provide shaded parking areas,and mitigate negative acoustic and visual impact of motor vehicles.
(b)
Design guidelines and standards.
(1) All parking lots containing 10 or more spaces shallbe landscaped to provide interior parking lot landscaping as requiredin subsection 5-2.2C at the rate of one landscaped parking space forevery 10 paved parking spaces.
(2) Landscaped islands shall be planted with a minimumof one tree and shrubs, live ground cover, or sod.
(3) Lighting for parking lots may be contained withininterior parking lot landscaped areas provided the trees selectedfor these areas shall have a mature height that will not conflictwith the light fixture.
4.
No areas for outdoor storage, trash collection or compaction,loading, or other such uses shall be located within any front yardor within 50 feet of any public street, public sidewalk, or internalpedestrian walkway.
5.
Loading docks, truck parking, outdoor storage, trash collection,trash compaction, and other service functions shall be incorporatedinto the overall design of the building and landscaping so that thevisual and acoustic impacts of these functions are fully containedand out of view from adjacent properties and public streets. Screeningmaterials shall be the same as, or of equal quality to, the materialsused for the primary building and landscaping.
6.
Nonenclosed areas for the storage and sale of seasonal inventoryshall be permanently defined and screened with landscaping, wallsand/or fences. Materials, colors, and design of screening walls and/orfences, and of any covering for such area, shall be compatible withthose used as predominant materials and colors on the primary building(s).
7.
To the extent screening is not addressed by the above standards, all service areas and dumpsters shall be screened according to Section 5-4.
8.
Mechanical/utility equipment screening.
(a)
Intent. Mechanical and utility equipment detracts from the characterof an area. Steps shall be taken to mitigate the negative visual andacoustic impacts of mechanical and utility equipment systems on surroundingdevelopment.
(b)
Design guidelines and standards.
(1) Mechanical/utility screening shall be an integralpart of the building structure and architecture and not give the appearanceof being "tacked on" to the exterior surfaces.
(2) All mechanical equipment and utilities shall bescreened.

J. To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resourcesby means of controlling increased flood discharges, stream erosion,and runoff pollution.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ LDO12-1.2      Applicability.

[[CONTENT]]
A. No application for development shall be accepted for filing unlessthe same includes sufficient information to carry out the intent andpurpose of this Article and a stormwater management plan as hereinprovided is presented.
B. No land area within the Township shall be developed so that:
1.
The rate of storm water runoff occurring in the area is increasedover what occurs there under existing conditions.
2.
The drainage of adjacent areas is adversely affected.
3.
Soil absorption and ground water recharge capacity of the areais decreased below what occurs there under existing conditions.

C. The Engineering Department shall administer the provisions of thissection and it shall be charged with the duty of promulgating regulationsto effectuate the intent of this section, including, among others,runoff control standards, runoff control details, and design of stormwater detention facilities.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ LDO12-1.3      Compatibility With Other Permit Requirements.

[[CONTENT]]
Development approvals issued pursuant to this Article are tobe considered an integral part of development approvals under thesubdivision and site plan review process and do not relieve the applicantof the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals foractivities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or article.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Articleshall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion ofthe public health, safety, and general welfare. This section is notintended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinances,rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. Where anyprovision of this Article imposes restriction different from thoseimposed by any other article, rule or regulation, or other provisionof law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higherstandards shall control.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ LDO12-1.4      Technical Standards.

[[CONTENT]]
Each proposed project not exempted from the implementation ofthis Article shall meet the following stormwater management standards.
A. Flood and erosion control.
1.
The flood and erosion control standards for detention will requirethat volumes and rates be controlled so that after development thesite will generate no greater peak runoff from the site than priorto development, for a two-, ten-, and 100-year storm considered individually.
2.
These design storms shall be defined as either a twenty-four-hourstorm using the Type III rainfall distribution recommended by the
U.S. Soil Conservation Service when using U.S. Soil Conservation Serviceprocedures, (such as U.S. Soil Conservation Service, "Urban Hydrologyfor Small Watersheds", Technical Release No. 55) or as the estimatedtime of concentration of runoff at the site when using a design methodsuch as the modified Rational Method.
3.
For purposes of computing runoff, all undeveloped or unpavedlands (e.g., cultivated, pasture, wooded or grassy) in the site shallbe assumed, prior to development, to be in good hydrologic condition,regardless of conditions existing at the time of computation. Forlands to be considered cultivated, they shall have been used for suchpurposes uninterruptedly for a period of at least seven of the last
10 years prior to the time of computation. If such uninterrupted usehas not occurred or cannot be satisfactorily documented, woods shallbe assumed to be the predeveloped land condition of the undevelopedor unpaved lands.
4.
Any major agricultural development as defined in the Articleshall be submitted to the local Soil Conservation District for reviewand comment in accordance with this Article and any Soil Conservation
District guidelines. Approval of such stormwater control measureswill be conditioned upon a positive approval of the Somerset County
Soil Conservation District.
5.
Soil erosion and sediment control shall be provided in accordancewith Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control promulgated bythe State Soil Conservation Committee pursuant to N.J.A.C. 4:24-42
administered by the Somerset County Soil Conservation District.
B. Water quality control. In order to provide sediment transport andparticulate contaminant pollution control from stormwater runoff,all site development stormwater management plans must provide forthe control of a water quality design storm. The water quality designstorm shall be defined as either the one-year frequency, twenty-four-hourstorm using the Type III rainfall distribution recommended for New
Jersey by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service or a storm of 1.25 inchesof rainfall falling uniformly in two hours.
The water quality design storm shall be controlled by one ofthe following practices:
1.
The water quality requirement for detention will require prolongeddetention of the runoff from the water quality design storm. Provisionsshall be made for it to be retained and released so as to evacuate
90% of the design storm stormwater runoff to the basin in 18 hoursin the case of residential development and 36 hours in the case ofall other developments. The detention time shall be considered a drawdowntime of the elected water quality design storm and, therefore, shallbegin at the time of peak storage of that storm. Drawdown time meansthat the time for a detention basin to translate from a peak storagecondition for the water quality design storm (maximum detention basinstage for that storm) to a time at which 90% of the volume of designstorm runoff stored has evacuated through the basin. Evacuation shallbe a gradual translation. If the above requirement would result inthe flow outlet smaller than three inches in diameter, the periodof detention shall be waived so that three inches will be the minimumoutlet size used. In the case of wet detention/retention basins, thepermanent storage water shall not be included in the analysis.
2.
Where soils have sufficient permeability, the production ofzero runoff from the site under conditions of the 1.25 inch waterquality storm will be considered sufficient to meet the water qualityrequirement for residential developments, provided that the seasonalhigh ground water does not rise to within two feet of the bottom ofthe detention facility. However, an infiltration device cannot beapplied on sites where subsurface conditions allow for rapid infiltration.
For other than residential development, approvals will be on a case-by-casebasis after technical review by the designated authority. The objectof this review will be to avoid the potential for contamination ofground water. Other technology may be substituted pursuant to this
Article.
C. Drainage design. Lots, buildings and parking areas shall be gradedto secure and assure proper drainage away from buildings. The landshall be so graded, paved areas so pitched and storm drains and catchbasins so located as to provide rapid runoff of storm waters and toavoid undue accumulations of water disturbing to occupants, underthe normal range of weather conditions.
1.
Plans for drainage improvements shall show the full area includedwithin the proposed drainage limits, including lands outside the tract;
present and future land use and approximate average slope of the drainagebasin; the profile and rate of gradient; location and size of proposedstorm drain, etc.; and show all existing storm design requirementsfor storm sewers shall be based on a sewer size of sufficient capacityto carry the runoff for a storm frequency period of 25 years withthe land use fully developed. The rational method may be used to determinequantity of runoff.
The gradients of the storm sewers shall be set to provide minimumvelocities of 3 fps and maximum velocities of 15 fps. The pipe sizedetermined to be adequate for the runoff computed shall be increasedby at least one standard pipe size for the type of pipe being usedin order to provide adequate allowance for the normal accumulationof sediment and debris in the storm drainage system. In no case shallthe pipe size in a surface water drainage system be less than 15 inchesin diameter.
2.
Any structure for enclosing, damming or bridging a natural streamshall comply with the most recent edition of the N.J.A.C. 7:8-1.1.
3.
All storm drains, manholes, headwalls and other appurtenancesshall be constructed in conformance with the most recent edition ofthe NJDOT Standards and Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction,
1989, Section 602.
4.
Street catch basins shall be located at all street intersectionsand with inlets on both sides of the street at intervals of not morethan 400 feet or such shorter distances as required to prevent theflow of subsurface water from exceeding 4.0 cubic feet per secondat the catch basin inlet. Access manholes shall be placed at a maximum
300-foot intervals throughout the system and at pipe junctions wherethere are no catch basins.
5.
Storm drain pipes running longitudinally along streets shallnot be located under curbing or sidewalks.
6.
For both major and minor developments, blocks and lots shallbe graded to secure proper drainage away from all buildings and toprevent the collection of stormwater from any lot to adjacent lots.
7.
In subdivisions, detention basins should be designed to accomplishits designed purpose. The Township shall have the right to acceptthe detention basin upon completion for maintenance and repair. Ifnot accepted by the Township, the maintenance and repair of the basinshall be the responsibility of all the property owners in the subdivisionserved by the detention basin.
8.
Detention and retention basins must have maximum side slopeof not less than 3:1.
D. In all cases, multiple level outlets or other fully automatic outletsshall be designed so that peak discharge rates from the developmentfor the design storms will not be increased from what could occurif the development were not constructed. Outlet waters shall be dischargedfrom the development at such locations and velocities as not to causeadditional erosion or additional channels downstream of the developmentand shall be in accordance with Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control administered by the Somerset County Soil Conservation District.
E. Where the project consists of two phases (I) new construction whichrequires provisions of storm drainage under the terms of this Articleand (II) repair or rehabilitation of existing structures and surfaceswhich does not result in increasing the extent of impervious areasor in rendering existing surfaces less pervious, the detention requirementsmay be computed on the basis of phase (I) exclusively.
F. If detention basins or other detention facilities are provided throughwhich water passes at times other than following rainfall, the Municipal
Engineer shall be consulted concerning design criteria. It will becomenecessary for detention requirements to be met, despite the necessityof passing certain low flows. This applies to all onstream or on-linedetention basins.
G. Detention basins located in freshwater wetlands may be allowed onlyin accordance with the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act, N.J.S.A.
13:9B-1 et seq., and any rules adopted pursuant thereto.
H. Any detention facility that impounds water through the use of anartificial dike, levee or other barrier and raises the water levelfive feet or more above the usual mean low water height when measuredfrom the downstream toe-of-dam to the emergency spillway crest isclassified as a dam and subject to the New Jersey Dam Safety Standards,
N.J.A.C. 7:20. All such dams must be designed, constructed, operatedand maintained in compliance with the rules of N.J.A.C. 7:20.
I. In many instances, the provision of separate detention facilitiesfor a number of single sites may be more expensive and more difficultto maintain than provision or joint regional facilities for a numberof sites. In such cases, the applicant or applicants may seek approvalunder this Article of joint regional detention facilities which willfulfill the requirements of this Article. However, compliance withthis Article must be achieved and may not be postponed.

§ LDO12-1.5      Drainage Area Landscaping.

[[CONTENT]]
A. Stormwater management areas include detention basins, drainage ditchesand swales, and wetlands areas. Sensitively-designed basins and swalesare encouraged to benefit the health, welfare and safety of residents.
Stormwater management areas shall be integrated areas as aestheticlandscape features, naturalized wetland areas, or active and passiverecreation areas, in addition to their stormwater management function.
1.
Stormwater detention basins and retention basins shall be designedin an organic configuration to blend into the surrounding landscapeand imitate a natural depression with an irregular edge. Linear, geometricbasins are unacceptable. Low flow channels and swales shall be designedin a meandering fashion.
2.
Access for maintenance and emergencies shall be maintained.
3.
Shade trees (2-2 1/2 inch caliper) shall be provided withinthe upper drier portion of detention basins.
4.
Drainage structures such as headwalls, outlet structures, culverts,biofilters, etc. shall be screened with wet-site tolerant plants.
5.
Outlet structures and headwalls shall be provided with a stoneor brick veneer when clearly visible from adjoining properties andstreets or clearly visible from units within multi-family developments.
6.
Retaining walls within stormwater basins are encouraged to increasevolume and decrease disturbance to existing vegetation.
7.
Landscaping upon detention and retention emergency overflowberms are not permitted unless approved by the Township Engineer.
8.
Water aerators shall be provided within retention basins.
9.
One or more of the following alternative landscape conceptsmay be used in addition to the above, where required and approvedby the Planning Board:
(a)
Reforestation. This landscape treatment is appropriate for detentionbasins and drainage areas that are not highly visible or are adjacentto areas of mature woodlands or wetlands. It reverts the disturbedarea to a revegetated, stable, low-maintenance, natural landscapeasset over time. Evergreen conifer trees shall be spaced one treeevery 10 feet around the perimeter of the detention basin or as directedby the Township Engineer. These trees shall be either spruce or hemlocksix feet to seven feet tall at planting time. The trees shall be inaccordance with the American Standards for Nursery Stock, sponsoredby the American Association of Nurserymen, Inc. and approved by the
American National Standards Institute, Inc. and shall be planted inaccordance with good horticultural practice.
(1) The area shall be graded creatively to blend intothe surrounding landscape and imitate a natural depression with anirregular edge. This shall include gentle berming. Linear, geometricbasins are unacceptable.
(2) The quantity of trees to be planted on the interiorof the basins shall be equal to the number of trees that would benecessary to cover the entire area, based upon a twenty-foot by twenty-footgrid to the high water line or outflow elevation. Of this number,
10% shall be 2 1/2 to three-inch caliper, 20% shall be one totwo-inch caliper, and 70% shall be six-foot to eight-foot height whips.
(3) The trees shall be planted in groves spaced fiveto 15 feet on center.
(4) No trees shall be planted within the two-year stormfrequency elevation.
(5) The ground plane shall be seeded with a naturalization,wildflower, and/or meadow grass mix approved by the Township Engineer.
Consideration should be given to the use of species indigenous tothe area and/or tolerant of typical wet/dry flood plain conditions.
(6) Plantings shall not be located within 20 feet oflow flow channels or any other associated detention utilities to allowfor maintenance.
(7) The perimeter area (slopes above the high waterline) shall include shade trees approximately 80/1,000 linear feet),evergreen trees (approximately 40/1,000 linear feet), ornamental treesand shrubs screening drainage structures and creating visual interests.
(8) Provision for emergency access as well as generalmaintenance of the basins shall be reviewed by the Township Engineer.
Plantings shall be designed to disguise yet not hinder vehicular access.
(9) Plantings are not permitted upon any emergencyoverflow berms associated with a detention basin unless approved bythe Township Engineer.
(b)
Recreation/open space feature. This landscape concept is appropriatein situations where a basin is the largest or only portion of openspace in an area or is adjacent to existing open space and recreationopen space is desired. It is also appropriate for smaller, highlyvisible basins where a visually pleasing open space area is desired.
The objective in these situations is to integrate the area into thelandscape using topography and plantings in order to complement thefunction of the area and to provide a visually interesting landscapefeature and/or recreation space.
(1) The area shall be graded creatively to blend intothe surrounding landscape and imitate and natural depression withan irregular edge. This shall include gentle berming.
(2) Provide perimeter plantings, including shade trees,formally or informally, evergreen trees to create and screen views,and small trees and shrubs to provide a continuous landscape stripscreening drainage structures and creating visual interest.
(3) Integrate buffer plantings with perimeter plantingswhere applicable.

§ LDO12-1.6      Planning and Design Standards for Maintenance and Repair.

[[CONTENT]]
A. The goal for the planning and design of a stormwater management facilityis for its operation with the least practical amount of maintenance.
To accomplish this, the facility shall be developed to eliminate avoidablemaintenance tasks, minimize the long term amount of regular maintenancetasks, and reduce the potential for extensive, difficult, and costlyremedial or emergency maintenance efforts.
B. Strong, durable, and noncorrodible materials, components, and fastenersshall be used to reduce required maintenance efforts. These include,but are not limited to, lightweight noncorrodible metals such as aluminumfor trash racks, orifice plates, and access hatches; hardy, diseaseresistant grasses for bottoms and side slopes as prescribed by Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Standards administered by the Somerset
County Soil Conservation District; reinforced concrete for outletstructures and inlet headwalls; and gabions for channel and outletlinings.
C. Detention facilities shall be designed to minimize propagation ofinsects, particularly mosquitoes.
D. Detention facilities should be designed in a harmonious and attractivemanner.
E. Detention facility outlets shall be designed to function withoutmanual, electric or mechanical controls.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ LDO12-1.7      Safety Measures.

[[CONTENT]]
Safety measures are to be incorporated in the design of allstormwater and infiltration control projects. These may include butnot be limited to fencing, warning signs/stadia rod indicating depthat lowest point, and outlet structures designed to limit public accessand shall be approved by the Township Engineering Department.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ LDO12-1.8      Detention Basins in Flood Plains.

[[CONTENT]]
A. There will be no detention basins in the floodway except for thoseon-stream.
B. New development must be in compliance with all applicable regulationsunder the Flood Hazard Area Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:16A-50 et seq.
C. In addition, new development, including construction of detentionbasins, should be avoided in flood plains, but where this is unavoidable,a special examination to determine adequacy of a proposed detentionfacility during extreme storm events shall be required. This examinationis required to determine what effects, if any, the tailwaters createdby the flood plain have on the outflow from and effective storagewithin the detention facility. All designs of basins in flood plains,therefore, should be based upon an accurate and thorough determinationof tailwater effects resulting from runoff from the site and the watershedcontribution to the flood plain.
D. In cases where detention basins, other than on-stream basins, areto be built in flood plains and in default of an analysis such asdescribed above, detention storage provided below the elevation ofthe 100-year flood (either specially calculated or taken from an official
State flood plain delineation map) will be credited as effective storageat a reduced proportion as indicated in Table 1 below:

§ LDO12-1.9      Alternatives to Detention Basins.

[[CONTENT]]
A. The basic requirements for water quantity and quality control willbe satisfied by means of detention basins and combination of measuresincluding, but not limited to, rooftop storage, tanks, drywells, orsheet flow through vegetated areas, with consideration for the appropriatenessof the facility, anticipated length of life, feasibility of continuedmaintenance, and environmental impacts (e.g., contamination of groundwater).
B. Non-structural management practices including, but not limited to,open space acquisition, stream encroachment and flood hazard controls,protection of wetlands, steep slopes and vegetation, should be coordinatedwith detention requirements. Changes in land use can often reducethe scope and cost of detention provisions required by means of appropriatechanges in runoff coefficients.
C. Any proposed alternative to detention basin use shall be approvedby the Township Engineer.

H. Whenever the stormwater management design includes one or more BMPsthat will infiltrate stormwater into subsoil, the design engineershall assess the hydraulic impact on the groundwater table and designthe site, so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adversehydraulic impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating anaturally or seasonally high water table, so as to cause surficialponding, flooding of basements, or interference with the proper operationof subsurface sewage disposal systems or other subsurface structureswithin the zone of influence of the groundwater mound, or interferencewith the proper functioning of the stormwater management measure itself.
I. Design standards for stormwater management measures are as follows:
1.
Stormwater management measures shall be designed to take intoaccount the existing site conditions, including, but not limited to,environmentally critical areas; wetlands; flood-prone areas; slopes;
depth to seasonal high water table; soil type, permeability, and texture;
drainage area and drainage patterns; and the presence of solution-pronecarbonate rocks (limestone);
2.
Stormwater management measures shall be designed to minimizemaintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and ensure properfunctioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the intake to the outletstructure, as appropriate, and shall have parallel bars with one-inchspacing between the bars to the elevation of the water quality designstorm. For elevations higher than the water quality design storm,the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall be spaced no greaterthan one-third the width of the diameter of the orifice or one-thirdthe width of the weir, with a minimum spacing between bars of oneinch and a maximum spacing between bars of six inches. In addition,the design of trash racks must comply with the requirements of Section
12-2.8.C;
3.

J. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirementsof this subchapter, provided the pollutant removal rates are verifiedby the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and certifiedby the Department. Manufactured treatment devices that do not meetthe definition of green infrastructure at Section 12-2.2 may be usedonly under the circumstances described at Section 12-2.4.O.4.
K. Any application for a new agricultural development that meets thedefinition of major development at Section 12-2.2 shall be submittedto the Soil Conservation District for review and approval in accordancewith the requirements at Sections 12-2.4.O, P, Q and R and any applicable
Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater runoff quantityand erosion control. For purposes of this subsection, "agriculturaldevelopment" means land uses normally associated with the productionof food, fiber, and livestock for sale. Such uses do not include thedevelopment of land for the processing or sale of food and the manufactureof agriculturally related products.
L. If there is more than one drainage area, the groundwater recharge,stormwater runoff quality, and stormwater runoff quantity standardsat Section 12-2.4.P,Q and R shall be met in each drainage area, unlessthe runoff from the drainage areas converge onsite and no adverseenvironmental impact would occur as a result of compliance with anyone or more of the individual standards being determined utilizinga weighted average of the results achieved for that individual standardacross the affected drainage areas.
M. Any stormwater management measure authorized under the municipalstormwater management plan or ordinance shall be reflected in a deednotice recorded in the Office of the County Clerk in which the development,project, project site, or mitigation area containing the stormwatermanagement measure is located, as appropriate, to the municipality.
1.
A form of deed notice shall be submitted to the municipalityfor approval prior to filing. The deed notice shall contain a descriptionof the stormwater management measure(s) used to meet the green infrastructure,groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quality, and stormwater runoffquantity standards at Section 12-2.4.O, P, Q and R and shall identifythe location of the stormwater management measure(s) in NAD 1983 State
Plane New Jersey FIPS 2900 US Feet or Latitude and Longitude in decimaldegrees. The deed notice shall also reference the maintenance planrequired to be recorded upon the deed pursuant to Section 12-2.5.B.5.
Prior to the commencement of construction, proof that the above requireddeed notice has been filed shall be submitted to the municipality.
Proof that the required information has been recorded on the deedshall be in the form of either a copy of the complete recorded documentor a receipt from the clerk or other proof of recordation providedby the recording office. However, if the initial proof provided tothe municipality is not a copy of the complete recorded document,a copy of the complete recorded document shall be provided to themunicipality within 180 calendar days of the authorization grantedby the municipality.
N. A stormwater management measure approved under the municipal stormwatermanagement plan or ordinance may be altered or replaced with the approvalof the municipality, if the municipality determines that the proposedalteration or replacement meets the design and performance standardspursuant to Section 12-2.4 of this ordinance and provides the samelevel of stormwater management as the previously approved stormwatermanagement measure that is being altered or replaced. If an alterationor replacement is approved, a revised deed notice shall be submittedto the municipality for approval and subsequently recorded with the
Office of the County Clerk and shall contain a description and locationof the stormwater management measure, as well as reference to themaintenance plan, in accordance with Section 12-2.4.M above. Priorto the commencement of construction, proof that the above requireddeed notice has been filed shall be submitted to the municipalityin accordance with Section 12-2.4.M above.
O. Green Infrastructure Standards.
1.
This subsection specifies the types of green infrastructure
BMPs that may be used to satisfy the groundwater recharge, stormwaterrunoff quality, and stormwater runoff quantity standards.
2.
To satisfy the groundwater recharge and stormwater runoff qualitystandards at Section 12-2.4.P and Q, the design engineer shall utilizegreen infrastructure BMPs identified in Table 1 at Section 12-2.4.F.
and/or an alternative stormwater management measure approved in accordancewith Section IV.G. The following green infrastructure BMPs are subjectto the following maximum contributory drainage area limitations:
Best Management Practice
Maximum Contributory Drainage Area
Dry Well
1 acre
Manufactured Treatment Device
2.5 acres
Pervious Pavement Systems
Area of additional inflow cannot exceed three times the areaoccupied by the BMP
Small-scale Bioretention Systems
2.5 acres
Small-scale Infiltration Basin
2.5 acres
Small-scale Sand Filter
2.5 acres
3.
To satisfy the stormwater runoff quantity standards at Section
12-2.4.R, the design engineer shall utilize BMPs from Table 1 or from
Table 2 and/or an alternative stormwater management measure approvedin accordance with Section 12-2.4.G.
4.
If a variance in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:8-4.6 or a waiverfrom strict compliance in accordance with Section 12-2.4.D is grantedfrom the requirements of this subsection, then BMPs from Table 1,
2, or 3, and/or an alternative stormwater management measure approvedin accordance with Section 12-2.4.G may be used to meet the groundwaterrecharge, stormwater runoff quality, and stormwater runoff quantitystandards at Section 12-2.4.P, Q and R.
5.
For separate or combined storm sewer improvement projects, suchas sewer separation, undertaken by a government agency or public utility
(for example, a sewerage company), the requirements of this subsectionshall only apply to areas owned in fee simple by the government agencyor utility, and areas within a right-of-way or easement held or controlledby the government agency or utility; the entity shall not be requiredto obtain additional property or property rights to fully satisfythe requirements of this subsection. Regardless of the amount of areaof a separate or combined storm sewer improvement project subjectto the green infrastructure requirements of this subsection, eachproject shall fully comply with the applicable groundwater recharge,stormwater runoff quality control, and stormwater runoff quantitystandards at Section 12-2.4.P, Q and R, unless the project is granteda waiver from strict compliance in accordance with Section 12-2.4.D.
P. Groundwater Recharge Standards.
1.
This subsection contains the minimum design and performancestandards for groundwater recharge as follows:
2.
The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factorsfor stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge calculations at Section
12-2.5, either:
(a)
Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that thesite and its stormwater management measures maintain 100 percent ofthe average annual pre-construction groundwater recharge volume forthe site; or
(b)
Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that theincrease of stormwater runoff volume from pre-construction to post-constructionfor the 2-year storm is infiltrated.
3.
This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to projectswithin the "urban redevelopment area," or to projects subject to 4
below.
4.
The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
(a)
Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High pollutantloading areas are areas in industrial and commercial developmentswhere solvents and/or petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored,or applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded or stored;
areas where hazardous materials are expected to be present in greaterthan "reportable quantities" as defined by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas where recharge wouldbe inconsistent with Department approved remedial action work planor landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for spills of toxicmaterials, such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities;
and
(b)
Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material." "Sourcematerial" means any material(s) or machinery, located at an industrialfacility, that is directly or indirectly related to process, manufacturingor other industrial activities, which could be a source of pollutantsin any industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source materialsinclude, but are not limited to, raw materials; intermediate products;
final products; waste materials; by-products; industrial machineryand fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents that are relatedto process, manufacturing, or other industrial activities that areexposed to stormwater.
Q. Stormwater Runoff Quality Standards.
1.
This subsection contains the minimum design and performancestandards to control stormwater runoff quality impacts of major development.
Stormwater runoff quality standards are applicable when the majordevelopment results in an increase of one-quarter acre or more ofregulated motor vehicle surface.
2.
Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce thepost- construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwaterrunoff generated from the water quality design storm as follows:
(a)
Eighty percent TSS removal of the anticipated load, expressedas an annual average shall be achieved for the stormwater runoff fromthe net increase of motor vehicle surface.
(b)
If the surface is considered regulated motor vehicle surfacebecause the water quality treatment for an area of motor vehicle surfacethat is currently receiving water quality treatment either by vegetationor soil, by an existing stormwater management measure, or by treatmentat a wastewater treatment plant is to be modified or removed, theproject shall maintain or increase the existing TSS removal of theanticipated load expressed as an annual average.
3.
The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to any stormwaterrunoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent limitationfor TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specificallyexempt under a NJPDES permit from this requirement. Every major development,including any that discharge into a combined sewer system, shall complywith 2 above, unless the major development is itself subject to a
NJPDES permit with a numeric effluent limitation for TSS or the NJPDES
permit to which the major development is subject exempts the developmentfrom a numeric effluent limitation for TSS.
4.
The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall intwo hours. Water quality calculations shall take into account thedistribution of rain from the water quality design storm, as reflectedin Table 4, below. The calculation of the volume of runoff may takeinto account the implementation of stormwater management measures.

6.
Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to reduce,to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction nutrient loadof the anticipated load from the developed site in stormwater runoffgenerated from the water quality design storm. In achieving reductionof nutrients to the maximum extent feasible, the design of the siteshall include green infrastructure BMPs that optimize nutrient removalwhile still achieving the performance standards in Section 12-2.4.P,
Q and R.
7.
In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent any increasein stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
8.
The Flood Hazard Area Control Act Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:13-4.1(c)1
establish 300-foot riparian zones along Category One waters, as designatedin the Surface Water Quality Standards at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and certainupstream tributaries to Category One waters. A person shall not undertakea major development that is located within or discharges into a 300-footriparian zone without prior authorization from the Department under

This stormwater runoff quality standards do not apply to theconstruction of one individual single-family dwelling, provided thatit is not part of a larger development or subdivision that has receivedpreliminary or final site plan approval prior to December 3, 2018,and that the motor vehicle surfaces are made of permeable material(s)
such as gravel, dirt, and/or shells.
R. Stormwater Runoff Quantity Standards.
1.
This subsection contains the minimum design and performancestandards to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts of major development.
2.
In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, thedesign engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwaterrunoff calculations at Section 12-2.5, complete one of the following:
(a)
Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that forstormwater leaving the site, post-construction runoff hydrographsfor the 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm events do not exceed, at any pointin time, the pre-construction runoff hydrographs for the same stormevents;
(b)
Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that thereis no increase, as compared to the pre-construction condition, inthe peak runoff rates of stormwater leaving the site for the 2-, 10-
and 100-year storm events and that the increased volume or changein timing of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damage at ordownstream of the site. This analysis shall include the analysis ofimpacts of existing land uses and projected land uses assuming fulldevelopment under existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainagearea;
(c)
Design stormwater management measures so that the post-constructionpeak runoff rates for the 2-, 10- and 100-year storm events are 50,
75 and 80 percent, respectively, of the pre-construction peak runoffrates. The percentages apply only to the post-construction stormwaterrunoff that is attributable to the portion of the site on which theproposed development or project is to be constructed; or
(d)
In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity analysisin accordance with 2.i, ii and iii above is required unless the designengineer demonstrates through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis thatthe increased volume, change in timing, or increased rate of the stormwaterrunoff, or any combination of the three will not result in additionalflood damage below the point of discharge of the major development.
No analysis is required if the stormwater is discharged directly intoany ocean, bay, inlet, or the reach of any watercourse between itsconfluence with an ocean, bay, or inlet and downstream of the firstwater control structure.
3.
The stormwater runoff quantity standards shall be applied atthe site's boundary to each abutting lot, roadway, watercourse,or receiving storm sewer system.

§ LDO12-2.5      Calculation of Stormwater Runoff and Groundwater Recharge.

[[CONTENT]]
[Added 2-22-2021 by Ord.
No. 2021-1404]
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
1.
The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of thefollowing methods:
(a)
The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in Chapters 7, 9, 10, 15 and 16 Part 630, Hydrology National Engineering Handbook, incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented. This methodology is additionally described in Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds (TR-55), dated June 1986, incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented. Information regarding the methodology is available from the Natural Resources Conservation Service website at: https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdbl0441 71.pdf or at United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, 220 Davison Avenue, Somerset, New Jersey 08873; or
(b)
The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations. The rational and modified rationalmethods are described in "Appendix A-9 Modified Rational Method" inthe Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey,
January 2014. This document is available from the State Soil Conservation
Committee or any of the Soil Conservation Districts listed at N.J.A.C.
2:90-1.3(a)3. The location, address, and telephone number for each
Soil Conservation District is available from the State Soil Conservation
Committee, PO Box 330, Trenton, New Jersey 08625. The document isalso available at: http://www.nj.gov/agriculture/divisions/anr/pdf/2014NJSoilErosionControlStandardsComplete.pdf.
2.
For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwaterrecharge, there is a presumption that the pre-construction conditionof a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good hydrologiccondition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both the NRCS
methodology above at Section 12-2.5.A.1.i and the Rational and Modified
Rational Methods at Section 12-2.5.A.1.ii. A runoff coefficient ora groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may beused on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifiesthat the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion ofthe site for at least five years without interruption prior to thetime of application. If more than one land cover have existed on thesite during the five years immediately prior to the time of application,the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used forthe computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the siteis in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture,lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), orwith good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if theland use type is cultivation).
3.
In computing pre-construction stormwater runoff, the designengineer shall account for all significant land features and structures,such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or culverts, thatmay reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates and volumes.
4.
In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the designengineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/orvolumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to accuratelycompute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff from the site. Tocalculate runoff from unconnected impervious cover, urban imperviousarea modifications as described in the NRCS Technical Release 55 -
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds or other methods may be employed.
5.
If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater managementmeasure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as definedat N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account theeffects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater managementmeasures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the following:
The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for Evaluating
Groundwater-Recharge Areas in New Jersey, incorporated herein by referenceas amended and supplemented. Information regarding the methodologyis available from the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual; at the New Jersey Geological Survey website at: https://www.nj.gov/dep/njgs/pricelst/gsreport/gsr32.pdfor at New Jersey Geological and Water Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, PO
