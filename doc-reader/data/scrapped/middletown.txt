Use of breakaway walls whichexceed a design safe loading of 20 pounds per square foot (eitherby design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permittedonly if a registered professional engineer or architect certifiesthat the designs proposed meet the following conditions:
[a] Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a waterload less than that which would occur during the base flood; and
[b] The elevated portion of the building and supportingfoundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement orother structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loadacting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural).
Water loading values used shall be those associated with the baseflood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicablestate or local building standards.
[3]
If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall beused solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storageand not for human habitation.

No. 2005-2808]
[5] Where the Municipal Agency approves any "d" variance,other than as already specified herein, the Board may impose a developmentfee of up to 6% of the additional value added to the property dueto the granting of said variance. Where it is determined that thereis no increase in value, or where a use variance is required simplyfor a change in use involving less than 5,000 square feet of grossfloor area and where no new construction is proposed, no fee shallbe imposed.[Amended 7-18-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-2825]
[6] In the case of any mixed-use development containing both residential and nonresidential uses, the required fee shall be based upon a separate calculation for each use utilizing the cost factors specified in Subsection D(19)(c)[1] and [2] of this section.[Amended 7-18-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-2825]

Should the method of applying the compound produce anonuniform film, its use shall be discontinued and the curing shallbe done by another method approved by the Engineer that will conformto the requirements for curing concrete.
(2)
Materials for curing: liquid compound, clear or translucent.
Clear or translucent liquid curing compound shall consist of a blendof resins and other suitable materials held in solution in a volatilesolvent. It shall not separate on standing, shall be nontoxic, andshall become dry to touch within four hours after being applied tothe concrete under ordinary conditions. Acceptance for continued usealso will be based upon satisfactory field performance.
(3)
Consistency. The consistency of the compound shall be such thatit can be applied to the concrete in the amount specified, as a finespray, by means of an atomizing nozzle.
(4)
Character of film. The compound shall adhere to damp, verticalor horizontal concrete surfaces forming a continuous coherent filmwhen applied at the specified rate. When dry, the film shall not betacky or track off the concrete when walked upon, nor impart a slipperycondition to the surface.
(5)
Color. The compound shall produce no darkening or changing ofthe color of the concrete which it is applied. It shall, however,be of such a nature or so treated that the film will be distinctivelyvisible for at least four hours after application. Any coloring matteradded to the compound shall be a fugitive organic dye of a color approvedby the Engineer. All trace of this color shall be indistinct 30 daysafter application.
(6)
Reaction with concrete. The compound shall not react deleteriouslywith the wet concrete and shall form a superficial layer over thesurface thereof.
(7)
Moisture retention. When tested in accordance with current ASTM
Designation C 156, the moisture loss shall be not more than 0.055
gram per square centimeter of the mortar specimen surface, based onthe amount of water in the mortar at the time the curing materialis applied.

The heightsof retaining walls should not exceed 1/3 of the horizontal distancefrom the foundation wall of any building to the face of the retainingwall.
H. Guardrails and/or railings shall be placed at all drainage structureswhere the interests of pedestrian or vehicular safety would dictate.
(1)
The Municipal Agency may require that any open channel, otherthan naturally occurring streams, be fenced with chain-link fencing
48 inches high if the banks of the channel are steeper than one footvertically for every four feet horizontally, and either the totaldepth of the channel exceeds four feet or the channel would be expectedto have a depth of flow greater than two feet more often than onceevery 10 years.
(2)
For maintenance purposes, gates may be required by the Municipal
Agency at approximately two-hundred-foot intervals.
I. The developer shall take all necessary precautions to prevent anysiltation of streams during the construction of the site.
(1)
If required by the Municipal Agency as a condition of approvalor by the Planning Board Engineer during construction, the developershall provide adequate provisions to prevent all deposits of siltor other eroding material in any stream or watercourse.
(2)
Such provisions may include, but not limited to constructionand maintenance of siltation basins or holding ponds throughout thecourse of construction.
(3)
The use of siltation and oil separation basins with controlledoutflows will be required to prevent pollution of waterways when dischargeis into a lagoon, bay or other standing body of water.
J. All drainage arrangements (either piped or overland flow) for siteson county roads or state highways shall be approved by the County
Engineer or the New Jersey Department of Transportation, respectively;
in addition to being acceptable to the Municipal Agency.
K. Stormwater runoff restrictions in all proposed subdivisions and multifamilyresidential developments with an area of 10 acres or more, and allbusiness, commercial and industrial development comprising a siteor tract area of five acres or more, the maximum design limit forstormwater runoff shall be 115% of the runoff generated by the sitein its natural conditions, unless downstream facilities have beendetermined to be fully adequate.
(1)
All runoff calculations shall be based on the Rational Formulaor the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's designflood runoff index curves.

The design criteria for the use of these methods is containedin the "Master Drainage Plan for Middletown Township," T & M Associates,
Middletown, New Jersey, seven volumes, as amended and supplemented.
(3)
In addition, any other method of calculation stormwater runoffthat is subsequently adopted for use by the Division of Water Resourcesof the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection shall alsobe acceptable.
L. Special drainage provisions.
(1)
The existing system of natural drainage within each developmentshall be reserved to the maximum extent possible. To this end, the
Board may require the preservation of natural drainage swales, rechargeareas, wet weather ponds and similar features and may require suitabledrainage and conservation easements and possible increases in lotsize to allow usable lots with the preservation of such features.
(2)
Subject to review and approval by the Board, the design of thedevelopment may be modified to take advantage of the natural drainagefeatures of the land. In such review, the Board will use the followingcriteria:
(a)
The utilization of the natural drainage system to the fullestextent possible.
(b)
The maintenance of the natural drainage system as much as possiblein its unimproved state.
(c)
When drainage channels are required, wide, shallow swales withnatural vegetation will be preferred to other sections.
(d)
The construction of flow-retarding devices, detention areasand recharge berms to minimize runoff value increases.
(e)
Maintenance of the base flow in streams reservoirs and ponds.
(f)
The reinforcement, improvement, and/or extension of the naturaldrainage system to such an extent as is necessary to eliminate floodingand excess maintenance requirements.
(3)
All developments or portions or total schemes of developmentwhich, based upon the preliminary plat submission, total 10 or moreacres, will be expected, to the extent that the Board considers possible,to limit the total stormwater runoff from the site after developmentto not more than 115% of the runoff from the site in its undevelopedstate. The utilization of the provisions of this section to limitsuch runoff are encouraged. However, the Board may require the useof reasonable artificial methods of detention and/or recharge if itdetermines that natural provisions are not feasible. The Board maywaive the provisions of this section if the nature of the development,the character of adjacent previously developed areas or other factorsmake the utilization of drainage features or runoff-limiting devicesinadvisable or impractical.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 540-640      Storm drainage calculation criteria.

[[CONTENT]]
A. Minimum basis for calculations for design storm frequency.
(1)
For closed conduits, five years; or if the above results ina conduit size at least equivalent to a twenty-one-inch reinforcedconcrete pipe, then 10 years; or if the above results in a conduitsize at least equivalent to a thirty-inch reinforced concrete pipe,then 25 years; or if the above results in a conduit size at leastequivalent to a fifty-four-inch reinforced concrete pipe, then 50
years.
(2)
For open channels, 10 years; or if the tributary area exceeds
320 acres, then 25 years; or if the tributary area exceeds 250 acres,then 50 years. The flooding limits for storms with a return periodof twice the design storm shall be determined for all open channels.
Such limits shall be the drainage or conservation easements delineatedon the plat.
(3)
For detention facilities, a twenty-four-hour flood with a returnperiod not less than 50 years or, if the tributary area exceeds 50
acres, then 100 years.
(4)
For retention facilities, double the capacity obtained by applyingthe requirements for detention facilities.
(5)
For gutter flow calculations, 10 years for local, local collectorand minor collector streets; 25 years for major collectors and minorarterials, and 50 years for principal arterials.
B. Runoff determinations should be made using the Rational Formula or,in unusual cases, other methods with the prior approval of the Township
Engineer. Upstream areas should be considered based on their fulldevelopment potential according to current zoning or the current use,whichever produces the greatest runoff. Runoff coefficients used shouldgenerally fall in the following ranges:
Classification, Fully Developed
Range of Coefficient
Public parks, open space and land conservation
0.15 to 0.30
Low-density residential
0.30 to 0.45
Medium-density residential
0.40 to 0.60
High-density residential
0.55 to 0.70
Commercial and industrial
0.60 to 0.90
Pavements, roadways, shoulders
1.00
C. Velocity restrictions. In general, velocities in closed conduitsat design flow should be at least 2.5 feet per second, but not morethan velocity which will cause erosion damage to the conduit, andvelocities in open channels at design flow shall not be less than
1.5 feet per second and not greater than that velocity which willbegin to cause erosion or scouring of the channel.
(1)
For unlined earth channels, the maximum velocity allowed willbe two feet per second. For other channels, sufficient design dataand soil tests to determine the character of the channel shall bemade to developer and shall be made available to the Township Engineerat the time of drainage review.
(2)
At transitions between closed conduits and open channels ordifferent types of open channels suitable provisions must be madeto accommodate the velocity transitions. These provisions may includeriprapping, gabions, lining, aprons, chutes and checks, or others,all suitable detailed and approved as part of the final plat submission.
(3)
For all flow of 40 cubic feet per second or more, tailwaterdepth and velocity calculations shall be submitted.
D. In general, the Manning formula will be used by the Township Engineerto review the adequacy of proposed drainage facilities.
(1)
Other formulas may be used in particular cases with the previousagreement of the Board.
(2)
A friction factor (n) of 0.012 will be used for nonporous concretepipe; a factor of 0.024 will be used for fully coated corrugated metalpipe with paved invert.
(3)
Commensurate factors will be used for other pipe type or shapes.
(4)
A friction factor (n) not less than 0.012 will be used for fullylined concrete channels; a factor not less than 0.025 will be usedfor good earth channels and a factor not less than 0.05 will be usedfor fair to poor natural streams and watercourses.
(5)
Commensurate factors will be used for other channel types.
E. All drainage facilities carrying runoff from tributary areas largerthan 1/2 square mile must have the approval of the New Jersey Departmentof Environmental Protection, Division of Water Policy and Supply.
Evidence of such approval shall be required to be submitted priorto the final approval of the site plan.
F. All encroachments of natural waterways must be referred to the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Water Resources,for approval in accordance with statute. The state may retain jurisdictionin which case a permit will be necessary as set forth above or mayrefer the matter to the County Engineer for review.
G. Storm drainage systems shall be designed to include not only theproper drainage of the actual area of the specific development andthe area tributary thereto, but shall also include the disposal ofthe stormwater runoff to an adequate outlet or other means of finaldisposal of the stormwater, such as an ocean, river, running stream,lagoon or an existing adequate storm sewer.
H. Whenever sump conditions occur, an analysis shall be made of theeffect of the occurrence of a major storm having at least one-hundred-yearreturn frequency. The effect of such storm and the flooding limitsanticipated shall be shown. Site design, grading, and drainage shallanticipate such major storm and be so arranged so as to prevent damageto existing or proposed structures or adjacent properties under suchconditions.

[Amended 10-19-1998 by Ord. No. 98-2529]
A. All major and minor arterial, collector, local collector, local andmarginal access streets shall be designed in accordance with the proposalscontained in the Master Plan of the Township and/or in accordancewith this subsection.
(1)
Upon receipt by the Municipal Agency of any subdivisions orsite plans calling for the installation of new streets or the extensionof old streets, the plats shall be referred to the Township Fire Advisory
Board and a representative of the Township Police Department for review.
(a)
They shall make recommendations as to the acceptable minimumwidths of each street and shall base the recommendations upon suchfactors as the location, proposed use and intensity of traffic, withan emphasis upon safety considerations of both a fire and police nature.
(b)
These recommendations shall be submitted to the Township Plannerto be considered in conjunction with such studies and statistics andother data which the Planner shall have assembled as a basis for determiningminimum street widths within the Township.
(2)
The design and location of local, collector, arterial and minoror marginal access streets shall be determined by the Municipal Agencyin their review of the applications so as to conform to the Scheduleof Street Design Standards (see Figure No. 5).[1]
[1]
Editor's Note: Figure No. 5, Schedule of Street Design Standards, referred to herein, may be found at the end in Subsection G of this § 540-641.
(3)
The enumerated standards are to be construed as minimum standardsand may be increased where, because of high traffic volumes, steepgrades or other such reasons, the Municipal Agency determines thatsuch action is necessary.
(4)
In residential subdivisions, the minimum street width requiredby the attached "Schedule of Street Design Standards" shall only bethe minimum for certain minor streets designed solely to allow accessby residents to their homes. The minimum width of any street in the
Township of Middletown is not to be less than 36 feet.
B. The arrangement of streets not shown on the Master Plan or Official
Map shall be such as to provide for the appropriate extension and/orrealignment of existing streets, except that local and collector streetsshould only be extended when such extension is necessary and the Municipal
Agency concurs that such extension will promote safety and conformto the street standards contained elsewhere in this chapter.
C. Where developments abut existing roadways, sufficient right-of-wayshall be reserved to provide the right-of-way width proposed for thefunctional classification of the street in question.
(1)
Subdivisions and site plans that adjoin or include existingstreets that do not conform to widths as shown on the Master Planor Official Map of the street width requirements of this chapter shalldedicate additional width along either one or both sides of said road.
(2)
If the subdivision and site plan is along one side only, 1/2
of the required extra width shall be dedicated.
(a)
The additional dedicated width, when improved, shall have afoundation course which shall be constructed by 2 1/2 inchesbroken stone compacted to a depth of six inches.
(b)
The wearing surface shall be constructed of two inches of bituminousconcrete from the center line of said road to the newly installedcurbs and blended into the existing pavement on the opposite sideof the center line.
(c)
Where the new wearing surface meets the old, it shall be treatedwith asphaltic oil type RC 2 or 3 and covered with 3/8 inch brokenstone to assure a tight bond.
(3)
The new cross section for the existing road shall be constructedso as to provide a parabolic contour constructed to the satisfactionof the Township Engineer.
D. Local streets shall be designed in accordance with the schedule ofstreet design standards and the requirements contained herein.
(1)
No street or road shall be designed which has an elevation atthe center line of less than 12 feet above mean low tide and as indicatedby the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey.
(2)
Local streets shall be arranged so that there exists a minimumpossibility of their use by traffic which does not have its originor destination at the lots to which the local streets provide access.
(3)
Culs-de-sac (dead-end streets) should have a center-line lengthfrom the intersecting street center line to the center point of theturnaround of the cul-de-sac of not less than 100 feet nor longerthan 600 feet and should not provide access to more than 25 lots.
(a)
They shall provide an end turnaround with a pavement radiusof not less than 50 feet and a property line radius of not less than
60 feet and tangent whenever possible to the right side of the street,when viewed toward the closed end.
(b)
In the event it is contemplated that a dead-end street shallbe extended in the future, a temporary turnaround meeting the aforementioneddesign criteria shall be required, and provisions made future extensionof the street and reversion of the excess right-of-way to the adjoiningproperties.
(4)
Loop streets should provide access to not more than 45 lots.
(a)
Except that where access is provided by a combination of a short-loopstreet and cul-de-sac, the maximum shall be 60 lots, provided thatthe length of the loop street alone will not exceed 3,000 feet.
(b)
Loop streets shall have both of their termini located on thesame street.
(5)
P-loops, which are loop streets with a single access point,should have an entrance not exceeding 700 feet in distance from theloop intersection.
(a)
There should also be provided an emergency vehicular and pedestrianright-of-way of 15 feet minimum width from the loop providing accessto a street which is not a part of the P-loop.
(b)
The loop of a P-loop should have a street length not exceeding
3,000 feet.
(c)
P-loops should provide access to no more than 60 lots and theentrance street should be designed in accordance with the design standardsfor collector streets.
(6)
Artificial modifications in street rights-of-way for the purposeof increasing lot frontage shall be prohibited. Such prohibited modificationshall include, but not be limited to, widening the right-of-way ofa continuous street through the use of semicircular projections.
(7)
Use of reduced paving width may be considered by the reviewagency when a cul-de-sac or loop street provides access to 25 or fewerlots, where, by reason of topography, physical features or other conditionsof the reduced paving width would substantially reduce disruptionof the development's environment.
(a)
In no case shall the paving width of a two-way cul-de-sac orloop street be reduced to less than 30 feet.
(b)
Such one-way streets with reduced paving width are subject tothe review and approval of the Traffic Bureau of the New Jersey Departmentof Transportation.
(c)
Such review and approval must be obtained by the developer beforeapproval of a final plat will be granted.
(8)
No new street, road or right-of-way created as part of a subdivisionor site plan shall be permitted within 10 feet of a side or rear lotline of an adjoining parcel not included as part of the development.
E. In any development, it shall be the duty of the Municipal Agencyto approve classification of proposed streets according to their use,and in accordance with the federal classification of roadways. Inmaking decisions, the review agency shall refer to the Master Planand the Monmouth County Planning Board classification of roadwaysand shall consider conditions within the development and the surroundingareas and shall use as a guide the street classification and criteriacontained herein.
(1)
A local street is a street serving only single-family residences,and where feasible, should be either a cul-de-sac or a loop streetmeeting the requirements hereinabove set forth.
(a)
A street which serves traffic having origins and destinationsother than within the lots which abut the street shall not be considereda local street.
(b)
The traffic normally expected on a local street shall be 400
vehicles per day.
(2)
A collector street is generally a street gathering traffic fromlocal streets and feeding it into a system of arterial highways.
(a)
Even if laid out as a local street, a street should be considereda collector street if it provides access or could provide access tomore than 150 lots, or would be utilized by traffic other than residentialin nature.
(b)
Collector streets should generally be expected to carry trafficvolumes of approximately 3,000 vehicles per day.
(c)
The design speed of collector streets, for alignment and sightdistance purposes, should be 50 miles per hour.
(3)
Arterials are any federal, state or county highway or municipalstreet or road intended to carry traffic between other arterials andfrom the Township to destinations outside the Township. Arterial highwaysshould have a design speed 55 miles per hour and should be designedto carry traffic exceeding 10,000 vehicles per day.
(4)
Expressways are high-speed, high-capacity, limited-access highwaysdevoted entirely to the movement of motor vehicles and provide nodirect access to abutting properties. They generally traverse largeareas, often an entire state, and connect with the freeways of adjoiningstates. Design features include the separation of opposing trafficlanes by a continuous center barrier or median strip, and full accesscontrol and grade separation at intersections or interchanges whichare generally widely spaced. Expressways usually have right-of-waywidths in excess of 150 feet, carry multiple lanes of traffic in eachdirection, and are generally designed for a capacity of between 1,000
and 1,500 vehicles per lane per hour.
(5)
Street classifications will be approved by the Municipal Agencyin accordance with the foregoing definitions, in accordance with theprovisions of the Master Plan and Official Map, if such be adopted,in accordance with the provisions of applicable county and state regulationsor plans or, in the absence of specific information from the above,in accordance with its own best judgment concerning the use to whichthe various streets in any development will be put.
F. In any subdivision abutting or being traversed by a collector streetor arterial highway, one of the following conditions shall be required,as the Board deems appropriate:
(1)
A marginal street meeting the classifications herein for a localstreet shall be provided along each collector or arterial highway,and shall be separated from the collector or arterial highway by alandscaped strip at least 25 feet in width.
(2)
The frontage of all lots abutting the collector or arterialhighway shall be reversed so that the lots will front on an internallocal street; a natural wooded or landscaped buffer strip at least
50 feet in width will be provided on the abutting lots along the right-of-wayof the collector or arterial highway. The area of such buffer stripshall not be considered part of the required minimum lot size.
(3)
All lots abutting collector streets may, in lieu of the above,be provided with suitable driveway turnarounds eliminating any necessityfor vehicles to back into the collector street.
(4)
Other means of providing a satisfactory buffer separating throughand local traffic shall be provided as may be deemed proper by the
Municipal Agency.
(5)
Dwellings on corner lots shall have their driveway access onthe roadway designed and intended to carry the lesser amount of traffic.
G. Street design standards shall be appropriate to the expected useof the street, soil, topographical and other physical conditions,and to the maintenance of the purposes of this chapter, but shallnot be less than those set forth herein and also in the Schedule of
Street Design Standards (Figure No. 5). All streets shall be constructedand graded and surfaced in accordance with these standards and specifications.

[[CONTENT]]
[Amended 9-21-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-2989]
A. Purpose.
(1)
The flood hazard areas of Middletown Township are subject toperiodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, healthand safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect thepublic health, safety, and general welfare. These flood losses arecaused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of specialflood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and wheninadequately anchored, causes damage in other areas. Uses that arefloodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage alsocontribute to the flood loss.
(2)
It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health,safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private lossesdue to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
(a)
To protect human life and health;
(b)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood controlprojects;
(c)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associatedwith flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the generalpublic;
(d)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(e)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such aswater and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streetsand bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(f)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sounduse and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimizefuture flood blight areas;
(g)
To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property isin an area of special flood hazard; and
(h)
To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazardassume responsibility for their actions.
(3)
Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this section and § 540-527 include methods and provisions for:
(a)
Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which resultin damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(b)
Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilitieswhich serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the timeof initial construction;
(c)
Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channelfloodwaters;
(d)
Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other developmentwhich may increase flood damage; and
(e)
Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barrierswhich will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase floodhazards in other areas.
B. Applicability. Any and all lands or portions of lands which extend into, traverse, or lie within the area of special flood hazard or floodplain as delineated in the report and maps referenced in § 540-901A(5) shall be subject to the rules and regulations as set forth herein as well as the other development regulations applicable to the zone district in which said lands are placed.
C. Prohibited uses. No person shall hereafter engage in or cause other persons to engage in any of the following prohibited activities or land uses within any portion of a flood hazard area, except as permitted as a lawful preexisting use pursuant to Article VII of this chapter:

In the event 11.11% of the total units shouldresult in a fraction equaling 0.5% or greater, the affordable housingobligation shall be rounded to the next higher number. Affordablehousing shall be as defined under the FHA and COAH's regulations.
B. Nonresidential development. Except as otherwise provided below, inthose circumstances where a developer develops land for nonresidentialpurposes and receives no right to an increased FAR or other compensatorybonus, the developer shall provide one non-age-restricted affordableunit for every 25 jobs projected to be created by this section. Thecalculation of the number of jobs and employment opportunities shallbe in accordance with Appendix E to N.J.A.C. 5:94-1, et seq. entitled
"UCC Use Groups for Projecting and Implementing Nonresidential Componentsof Growth Share."

[1] Design engineers shall use either of the followinggrates whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground surfaceto collect stormwater from that surface into a storm drain or surfacewater body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT
Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design Guidelines;
or
[b] A different grate, if each individual clear spacein that grate has an area of no more than seven square inches, oris no greater than 0.5 inch across the smallest dimension.
[2] Examples of grates subject to this standard includegrates in grate inlets, the grate portion (noncurb-opening portion)

For curb-opening inlet, including curb-opening inlets in combinationinlets, the clear space in that curb opening (or each individual clearspace, if the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall havean area of no more than 7.0 square inches, or be no greater than 2.0
inches across the smallest dimension.
(c)
This standard does not apply:
[1] Where each individual clear space in the curb openingin existing curb-opening inlet does not have an area of more than
9.0 square inches;
[2] Where the municipality determines that the standardswould cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could not practicablybe overcome by using additional or larger storm drain inlets;
[3] Where flows from the water quality design stormas specified in N.J.A.C. 7:8 are conveyed through any device (e.g.,end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment device, or acatch basin hood) that is designed, at a minimum, to prevent deliveryof all solid and floatable materials that could not pass through oneof the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 (4.625) inches longand 1 1/2 (1.5) inches wide (this option does not apply for outfallnetting facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
Note that these exemptions do not authorize any infringementof requirements in the Residential Site Improvement Standards forbicycle safe grates in new residential development (N.J.A.C. 5:21-4.18(b)2
and 7.4(b)1).
[4] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack thathas parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to the elevationof the water quality design storm as specified in N.J.A.C. 7:8; or
[5] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey Register of Historic
Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that action to meet this standardis an undertaking that constitutes an encroachment or will damageor destroy the New Jersey Register listed historic property.
F. An alternative stormwater management measure, alternative removal rate, and/or alternative method to calculate the removal rate may be used if the design engineer demonstrates the capability of the proposed alternative stormwater management measure and/or the validity of the alternative rate or method to the municipality. A copy of any approved alternative stormwater management measure, alternative removal rate, and/or alternative method to calculate the removal rate shall be provided to the Department in accordance with § 540-1008C. Alternative stormwater management measures may be used to satisfy the requirements at § 540-1005I only if the measures meet the definition of green infrastructure at § 540-1003. Alternative stormwater management measures that function in a similar manner to a BMP listed at § 540-1005I(2) are subject to the contributory drainage area limitation specified at § 540-1005I(2) for that similarly functioning BMP. Alternative stormwater management measures approved in accordance with this subsection that do not function in a similar manner to any BMP listed at § 540-1005I(2) shall have a contributory drainage area less than or equal to 2.5 acres, except for alternative stormwater management measures that function similarly to cisterns, grass swales, green roofs, standard constructed wetlands, vegetative filter strips, and wet ponds, which are not subject to a contributory drainage area limitation. Alternative measures that function similarly to standard constructed wetlands or wet ponds shall not be used for compliance with the stormwater runoff quality standard unless a variance in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:8-4.6 or a waiver from strict compliance in accordance with § 540-1005D is granted from § 540-1005I.
G. Wheneverthe stormwater management design includes one or more BMPs that willinfiltrate stormwater into subsoil, the design engineer shall assessthe hydraulic impact on the groundwater table and design the site,so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulicimpacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a naturallyor seasonally high water table, so as to cause surficial ponding,flooding of basements, or interference with the proper operation ofsubsurface sewage disposal systems or other subsurface structureswithin the zone of influence of the groundwater mound, or interferencewith the proper functioning of the stormwater management measure itself.
H. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1)
This subsection contains minimum design and performance standardsto control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and groundwaterrecharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity impacts of majordevelopment, redevelopment and adaptive reuse.
(a)
The minimum design and performance standards for erosion controlare those established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(b)
The minimum design and performance standards for groundwaterrecharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge calculations at § 540-1006, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysisthat the site and its stormwater management measures maintain 100%
of the average annual preconstruction groundwater recharge volumefor the site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysisthat the increase of stormwater runoff volume from preconstructionto postconstruction for the two-year storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to projects subject to § 540-1005H(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not berecharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading.
High pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and commercialdevelopments where solvents and/or petroleum products are loaded/unloaded,stored, or applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded orstored; areas where hazardous materials are expected to be presentin greater than reportable quantities as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas whererecharge would be inconsistent with Department-approved remedial actionwork plan or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for spillsof toxic materials, such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities;
and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or machinery located at anindustrial facility that is directly or indirectly related to process,manufacturing or other industrial activities, which could be a sourceof pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater.
Source materials include, but are not limited to, raw materials; intermediateproducts; final products; waste materials; by-products; industrialmachinery and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents thatare related to process, manufacturing, or other industrial activitiesthat are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulicimpact on the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoidadverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic impacts include,but are not limited to, exacerbating a naturally or seasonally highwater table so as to cause surficial ponding, flooding of basements,or interference with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposalsystems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or downgradientof the groundwater recharge area.
(c)
In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff calculations at § 540-1006, complete one of the following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysisthat for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction runoff hydrographsfor the two-, ten-, and one-hundred-year storm events do not exceed,at any point in time, the preconstruction runoff hydrographs for thesame storm events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysisthat there is no increase, as compared to the preconstruction condition,in the peak runoff rates of stormwater leaving the site for the two-,ten-, and one-hundred-year storm events and that the increased volumeor change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damageat or downstream of the site. This analysis shall include the analysisof impacts of existing land uses and projected land uses assumingfull development under existing zoning and land use ordinances inthe drainage area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that thepostconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and one-hundred-yearstorm events are 50%, 75% and 80%, respectively, of the preconstructionpeak runoff rates. The percentages apply only to the postconstructionstormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the siteon which the proposed development or project is to be constructed.
The percentages shall not be applied to postconstruction stormwaterrunoff into tidal flood hazard areas if the increased volume of stormwaterrunoff will not increase flood damages below the point of discharge;
or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity analysis in accordance with Subsection H(1)(c)[1], [2] and [3] above is required unless the design engineer demonstrates through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the increased volume, change in timing, or increased rate of the stormwater runoff, or any combination of the three will not result in additional flood damage below the point of discharge of the major development, redevelopment, and adaptive reuse. No analysis is required if the stormwater is discharged directly into any ocean, bay, inlet, or the reach of any watercourse between its confluence with an ocean, bay, or inlet and downstream of the first water control structure.
[5] The stormwater runoff quantity standards shall be applied at thesite's boundary to each abutting lot, roadway, watercourse, or receivingstorm sewer system.
(2)
Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the definition of "major development," "redevelopment" and "adaptive reuse" in § 540-1003 shall be submitted to the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval in accordance with the requirements of §  540-1005H(1)(b) and (c), I and J and any applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale. Such uses do not include the development of land for the processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally related products.
I. Greeninfrastructure standards.
(1)
This subsection specifies the types of green infrastructure
BMPs that may be used to satisfy the groundwater recharge, stormwaterrunoff quality, and stormwater runoff quantity standards.
(2)
To satisfy the groundwater recharge and stormwater runoff quality standards at § 540-1005H(1)(b) and J, the design engineer shall utilize green infrastructure BMPs identified in Table 1 at § 540-1005E(2) and/or an alternative stormwater management measure approved in accordance with § 540-1005F. The following green infrastructure BMPs are subject to the following maximum contributory drainage area limitations:
Best Management Practice
Maximum Contributory Drainage Area
Dry well
1 acre
Manufactured treatment device
2.5 acres
Pervious pavement systems
Area of additional inflow cannot exceed three times the areaoccupied by the BMP
Small-scale bioretention systems
2.5 acres
Small-scale infiltration basin
2.5 acres
Small-scale sand filter
2.5 acres
(3)
To satisfy the stormwater runoff quantity standards at § 540-1005H(1)(c), the design engineer shall utilize BMPs from Table 1 or from Table 2 and/or an alternative stormwater management measure approved in accordance with § 540-1005F.
(4)
If a variance in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:8-4.6 or a waiver from strict compliance in accordance with § 540-1005D is granted from the requirements of this subsection, then BMPs from Table 1, 2, or 3, and/or an alternative stormwater management measure approved in accordance with § 540-1005F may be used to meet the groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quality, and stormwater runoff quantity standards at § 540-1005H(1)(b) and (c) and J.
(5)
For separate or combined storm sewer improvement projects, such as sewer separation, undertaken by a government agency or public utility (for example, a sewerage company), the requirements of this subsection shall only apply to areas owned in fee simple by the government agency or utility, and areas within a right-of-way or easement held or controlled by the government agency or utility; the entity shall not be required to obtain additional property or property rights to fully satisfy the requirements of this subsection. Regardless of the amount of area of a separate or combined storm sewer improvement project subject to the green infrastructure requirements of this subsection, each project shall fully comply with the applicable groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quality control, and stormwater runoff quantity standards at § 540-1005H(1)(b) and (c) and J, unless the project is granted a waiver from strict compliance in accordance with § 540-1005D.
J. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1)
This subsection contains the minimum design and performancestandards to control stormwater runoff quality impacts of major development,redevelopment, and adaptive reuse. Stormwater runoff quality standardsare applicable when the major development, redevelopment, and adaptivereuse results in an increase of 1/4 acre or more of regulated motorvehicle surface.
(2)
Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce thepost-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwaterrunoff generated from the water quality design storm as follows: i,
80% TSS removal of the anticipated load, expressed as an annual averageshall be achieved for the stormwater runoff from the net increaseof motor vehicle surface; ii, if the surface is considered regulatedmotor vehicle surface because the water quality treatment for an areaof motor vehicle surface that is currently receiving water qualitytreatment either by vegetation or soil, by an existing stormwatermanagement measure, or by treatment at a wastewater treatment plantis to be modified or removed, the project shall maintain or increasethe existing TSS removal of the anticipated load expressed as an annualaverage. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to any stormwaterrunoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent limitationfor TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specificallyexempt under a NJPDES permit from this requirement. Every major development,including any that discharge into a combined sewer system, shall complywith i and ii above, unless the major development, redevelopment oradaptive reuse is itself subject to a NJPDES permit with a numericeffluent limitation for TSS or the NJPDES permit to which the majordevelopment, redevelopment or adaptive reuse is subject exempts thedevelopment from a numeric effluent limitation for TSS. The waterquality design storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Waterquality calculations shall take into account the distribution of rainfrom the water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 4. Thecalculation of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementationof nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both the NRCS methodology at § 540-1006A(1)(a) and the Rational and Modified Rational Methods at § 540-1006A(1)(b). A runoff coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover have existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3)
In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design engineershall account for all significant land features and structures, suchas ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or culverts that may reducepreconstruction stormwater runoff rates and volumes.
(4)
In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the designengineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/orvolumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to accuratelycompute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff from the site. Tocalculate runoff from unconnected impervious cover, urban imperviousarea modifications as described in the NRCS Technical Release 55 -
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5)
If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater managementmeasure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as definedat N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account theeffects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater managementmeasures.
