Notes, Table 2B: | 
1. In the WF and PF Districts, and in cases of public/semipublic
uses in all districts, site regulations not otherwise specified will
be determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission on a use permit/design
review basis. | 
2. Live/work space will be included in the calculation of commercial
floor area and will be subject to the maximum FAR standards for each
district. District standards for minimum lot area per dwelling shall
not apply to live/work units. See Table 1 for land use permitting
procedures for live/work in individual districts. | 
3. (Reserved) | 
4. Maximum building height is three stories and 38 feet, above
grade, except that where the rear property line abuts a residential
district, the maximum height shall be 20 feet in height at a point
10 feet back from the residential district property line, plus a forty-five-degree
daylight plane to the maximum permitted height; or alternatively 12
feet in height at the property line, then, horizontally to a point
10 feet from the property line, plus a thirty-five-degree from vertical
daylight plane to the maximum permitted height. (See Subsection 20.24.070.A,
Figures 1.a and 1.b.) If there is a difference in grade planes between
two adjacent parcels, the Community Development Director shall determine
appropriate grade plane to be used for daylight plane calculation.
No projections shall be allowed in the area between the daylight planes
and rear property line. Usable open spaces located on top of the structure,
within 10 feet of a residential district boundary, shall have a solid
fence or wall six feet in height. The combined height of the structure
and the wall shall comply with daylight plane requirements of this
Code. | 
5. No enclosed structure shall be located within 100 feet of
the shoreline, except as specified in the Waterfront Master Plan.
Continuous public access to the water's edge shall be preserved and
established consistent with The Bay Trail—Planning for a Recreational
Ring Around the Bay (ABAG, July 1989). | 
6. Through lots are deemed to have two front property lines,
one at each street, and front yard setback requirements shall be applicable
to both lines. | 
7. None required along San Pablo Avenue. If front setback is
provided, it shall not exceed a depth of four feet at street level.
Where fronting a street immediately parallel to San Pablo Avenue:
15 feet, plus a daylight plane. (See Subsection 20.24.070.B.) Where
a property in the SC District has an exterior lot line at a street
that intersects with Solano Avenue, and any property located directly
across such a street is in a residential district: 15 feet, plus a
daylight plane. (See Subsection 20.24.070.B.) | 
8. None, except where an interior side or rear yard of a nonresidential
property abuts an R District: See Subsection 20.24.070.A. | 
9. The minimum setbacks where a lot abuts an R District shall
be 10 feet at either side or rear yards. | 
10. May be waived by Planning and Zoning Commission, except

Notes, Table 2A: | 
1. In R-4 District, site regulations not specified will be determined
by the Planning and Zoning Commission on consideration of an application
for a use permit. Existing densities of developed sites are deemed
to be conforming, but existing densities will not be permitted to
be increased above the maximum density permitted in the R-3 District. | 
2. In the RHD District, all multiple-family development, and
any single-family development which comprises two or more acres of
land area, shall be processed as a development plan under planned
unit development procedures specified in Subsection 20.100.060. See
Subsection 20.24.040 for development regulations applicable to the
RHD District in addition to the regulations stated in this table. | 
3. The higher maximum density stated in the General Plan takes
into account the pre-existence of substandard nonconforming lots. | 
4. The Albany General Plan divides the area subject to the RHD
District into two density classifications:
Low density = 6 dwelling units/acre.
High density = 9 dwelling units/acre.
Through the planned unit development process (Subsection 20.100.060),
allowable density may be reduced according to slope density restrictions
and/or the presence of natural topographic features.
The City may permit the transfer of density from one portion
of a development site to another, upon making a finding that the density
transfer is necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter. | 
5. The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve a floor/area
ratio of up to 0.60 based on determination that any of the following
conditions exist:
(a) The site is of such a size that application
of the 0.55 floor/area ratio would result in a gross square footage
of less than 1,500 square feet.
(b) The site is in a zone other than R-1 and buildings
on any surrounding properties exceed FAR 0.60, and the higher FAR
is warranted by considerations of harmonious transition among properties.
(c) The proposed design has architectural features
that contribute substantially to neighborhood quality, which could
not be achieved in a smaller building mass. | 
6. FAR may be increased to 1.75 where open space is provided
at twice the minimum requirement stated in Subsection 20.24.090.B. | 
7. Enclosed off-street parking shall be included in the calculation
of the FAR, except that such parking area that is located entirely
below grade may be excluded. (See Subsection 20.24.050.C.) | 
8. Applies to single-family development in RHD District on land
comprising less than two acres. Also shall be considered to be the
minimum standards required for development of a single-family planned
unit development on two acres or more, except that modified development
standards may be approved if deemed appropriate by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council. | 
9. (Reserved) | 
10. Existing lots which do not meet minimum area standards may
be developed or improved as provided in § 20.44, Nonconforming
Uses, Structures and Lots. | 
11. For public and quasi-public uses, lot coverage and yard
setbacks will be determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission
on consideration of an application for a use permit or design review. | 
12. Planning and Zoning Commission, subject to design review
criteria, may grant a use permit to allow greater height for second-story
additions, up to 35 feet, measured in accordance with Subsection 20.24.080,
and based on at least one of the following findings:
a. The existing house has a partial ground story that causes
an increase in the overall height of the building, and there are sound
design reasons for considering a roofline which exceeds 28 feet.
b. The natural downward or upward topography of the site causes
an increase in the overall height of the building. The minimum roof
pitch has been maintained on the addition to be consistent with the
existing architectural design of the house. The height has been measured
from the natural or finished grade to the highest point of the roof.
c. The existing architectural character and design of the house
is maintained. Design factors have been considered to offset or minimize
the increased height, such as breakup in the mass and bulk, offsetting
one or more portions of the addition from the ground-story wall line,
and adding architectural details and elements such as horizontal trim
or other features to create interest. | 
13. Height limits in RHD District are specified for single-family
residences only. The maximum building height for a single-family residence
on a downhill site shall be 35 feet above the original grade of a
site measured from the midpoint of the building envelope. The maximum
permitted height for a single-family residence on an uphill site shall
be 28 feet above the original grade of a site measured from the midpoint
of the building envelope. | 
14. Maximum building height is three stories and 35 feet, above
natural or finished grade, whichever is lower, except that the maximum
height allowed at the front setback line shall be 28 feet plus a forty-five-degree
daylight plane. (See Subsection 20.24.070.B.) | 
15. Through lots are deemed to have two front property lines,
one at each street, and front yard setback requirements shall be applicable
to both lines. | 
16. 10% of lot width, up to a maximum of five feet, with a minimum
requirement of three feet, except that the minimum setback for multifamily
structures in the R-3 District is five feet. | 
17. 10% of lot width, or five feet, whichever is greater. | 
18. One foot shall be added for each 12 feet of height above
the lowest 15 feet of building height. | 
19. Exceptions to setback requirements may be made in the case
of a second-story addition to a single-family dwelling, as follows: | 
(a)Vertical extension of nonconforming walls. Existing
nonconforming walls which encroach into required setback areas shall
be allowed to extend in a vertical plane under or over an existing
wall, subject to design review by the Planning and Zoning Commission
and obtaining a use permit. | 
(b)Horizontal extension of nonconforming walls.
Existing nonconforming walls which encroach into the required front
yard or side yard setback areas may be extended in a in a horizontal
plane, subject to design review by the Planning and Zoning Commission
and obtaining a use permit. Such extensions shall not further encroach
on any required setback (i.e., a nonconforming wall which encroaches
one foot into a required setback shall not be permitted to encroach
two feet), nor shall any such extension create a new encroachment
in another direction. Required conditional use permit and design review
findings for the extension of a nonconforming front wall shall be
made separately from findings required for extension of other nonconforming
walls. |

repairs shall be permitted that restore the building to its pre-damage
state, using materials and strengths that existed prior to the damage. | 
3403.5.2.2.3 Extent of repair for non-compliant
buildings. If the evaluation does not establish compliance
of the pre-damage building in accordance with Section 3403.5.2.2.1,
then the building shall be rehabilitated to comply with applicable
provisions of the building code for load combinations including wind
or seismic forces. The wind design level for the repair shall be as
required by the building code in effect at the time of original construction
unless the damage was caused by wind, in which case the design level
shall be as required by the code in effect at the time of original
construction or as required by the building code, whichever is greater.
