INTRODUCTION
In 1998, the Zoning Commission of the Borough
of Newtown began a project to establish a Village District in accordance
with the authority provided by § 8-2j of the General Statutes
and to incorporate in the district a set of design guidelines that
would protect the distinctive character, landscape and historic values
set forth in the Plan of Development. The members of the committee
considered State, regional and municipal policies and past decisions
and studied similar documents from regulatory commissions of village
districts in other jurisdictions, as well as the federal standards
for rehabilitation of properties. | 


b        zoning
https://ecode360.com/9878268

Historic Continuity
The historic value of the commercial center
of the Borough is found in the design of its individual buildings,
the street scene, and the overall relationship of buildings, streets
and topography as well as vehicular and pedestrian traffic and densities
of uses. The architecture and the street scene are a reflection of
a society, economy, and technology somewhat different from today's.
The Borough's commercial center evolved in a simpler society and before
the widespread availability of electricity, large machinery, easy
transportation, low cost steel and glass, and elevators. The general
appearance of street vistas and the present character of separate
buildings represent an accumulation of many periods. The overall pattern
of streets, lots, buildings, and landmarks was established in the
18th century and followed in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, caution
and vigilance remain essential to the continued preservation of the
Borough through regulation of the commercial center. |

 | The minimum lot area for such special exception uses shall be
computed as (1) four times the gross floor area of all buildings of
the lot; (2) two times the area of the lot devoted to the proposed
use, including without limitation, the gross floor area of all buildings
and the area of all other structures, parking areas, loading areas
and driveways; or (3) where a lot is split by a zone line the minimum
lot area of the highest acre zone in which any part of the lot lies,
whichever is greater. |

https://ecode360.com/9878268
0.5348976032856524
The guidelines are not designed to promote any
particular architectural styles. Their role is to protect existing
properties against incorrect alterations and, as new buildings are
built and additions made to existing structures, to preserve the continuity
and architectural unity of the district. Within that overall unity
today are a variety of styles and settings, and, as a result, different
new buildings could be compatible. Some buildings, however, may not
be. For that reason, the intent of the guidelines is to be selective-and
sometimes restrictive-in order to exclude designs that would erode
the historic, cultural and economic resource built up over generations. | 


b        zoning
https://ecode360.com/9878268
0.5259379548716189
Village District development is controlled by
zoning regulations that are to be interpreted with the help of such
Village District Design Guidelines as may be adopted by the Commission
from time to time. Guidelines have a role that is different in nature
from the zoning regulations. Guidelines do not always dictate specific
limits, nor does strict adherence to them necessarily assure approval.
Evaluation of buildings requires judgment in studying plans submitted.
The Commission has to consider each design on its own merit, as well
as its effect on the neighborhood and the Borough as a whole. By themselves,
guidelines do not guarantee excellent or even mediocre architecture.
The important point is that by following these guidelines, the property
owner is doing his part to help the Commission protect the fragile,
irreplaceable environment of the Borough. |

Overall Unity
Courts have not attempted to define these special
qualities but rather have looked more toward a total concept or overall
unity, as the definitive statement. The wording of the "Village District"
statute, general rather than categorical, seems to take into account
that, within the overall entity of a Village District, there is a
spread of historic styles, cultural influence, land use and density.
However general this phraseology, its thrust and intention are unmistakable. |

Distinctive Character
Anything as subtle as charm is difficult to
define, and the quaint and distinctive character of the center defies
exact definition as well. Its history and that of the Town as a whole
inform it. The component parts of the Borough interrelate in a subtle
and distinctive way: the repetition and similarity of house after
house with similar or special architectural details and seldom of
greater height than three stories; a mix of small and grand houses
on small lots facing adjacent streets; a variety of small business
and professional offices. These elements have produced the ambience
of the Borough for leisurely living and have given it quaint and distinctive
New England small town charm that is found with decreasing frequency. |

Design Quality
While the quality of a building's design may
not improve with age, every generation must evaluate the significance
of architectural styles and examples, being guided by the wisdom of
the past and wary of its folly. Some buildings that are interesting
and intriguing now, for instance, were previously considered to have
very little value. |
