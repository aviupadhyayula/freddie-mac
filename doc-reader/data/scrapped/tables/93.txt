 | Sample Calculation:
A site has a total buffer length of 500 feet. The area encompassed
by the Zone B portion of the buffer is equal to 15 feet by 500 feet
= 7,500 square feet of buffer. The Zone A buffer is equal to 10 feet
by 500 feet = 5,000 square feet with a total buffer area of 12,500
square feet. As long as the area contained within the newly configured
Zone B buffer is equal to or greater than 7,500 square feet, the plan
will meet the buffer requirements of this article. |
