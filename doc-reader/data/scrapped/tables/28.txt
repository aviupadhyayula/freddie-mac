(a) | Notwithstanding any general statute or municipal ordinance or
regulation pertaining to nuisances to the contrary, no agricultural
or farming operation, place, establishment or facility, or any of
its appurtenances, or the operation thereof, shall be deemed to constitute
a nuisance, either public or private, due to alleged objectionable
(1) odor from livestock, manure, fertilizer or feed, (2) noise from
livestock or farm equipment used in normal, generally acceptable farming
procedures, (3) dust created during plowing or cultivation operations,
(4) use of chemicals, provided such chemicals and the method of their
application conform to practices approved by the Commissioner of Energy
and Environmental Protection or, where applicable, the Commissioner
of Public Health, or (5) water pollution from livestock or crop production
activities, except the pollution of public or private drinking water
supplies, provided such activities conform to acceptable management
practices for pollution control approved by the Commissioner of Energy
and Environmental Protection; provided such agricultural or farming
operation, place, establishment or facility has been in operation
for one year or more and has not been substantially changed, and such
operation follows generally accepted agricultural practices. Inspection
and approval of the agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment
or facility by the Commissioner of Agriculture or his designee shall
be prima facie evidence that such operation follows generally accepted
agricultural practices. | 
(b) | Notwithstanding any general statute or municipal ordinance or
regulation pertaining to nuisances, no operation to collect spring
water or well water, as defined in section 21a-150, shall be deemed
to constitute a nuisance, either public or private, due to alleged
objectionable noise from equipment used in such operation, provided
the operation (1) conforms to generally accepted practices for the
collection of spring water or well water, (2) has received all approvals
or permits required by law, and (3) complies with the local zoning
authority's time, place and manner restrictions on operations to collect
spring water or well water. | 
(c) | The provisions of this section shall not apply whenever a nuisance
results from negligence or willful or reckless misconduct in the operation
of any such agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment
or facility, or any of its appurtenances. |
