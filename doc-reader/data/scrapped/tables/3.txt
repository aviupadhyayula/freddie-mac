90-13. Approval. Upon the completion of the electrical
wiring in or on any building or structure of any nature, or any tent
or premises, except as otherwise exempted in this Article, the person,
firm, or corporation installing the same shall notify the Inspector,
who shall inspect such installation, and if it is found by him to
be fully in compliance with the provisions of this Article, he shall
issue, as provided for herein, the certificate of inspection or approval
tag authorizing the connection of the electrical service and the energizing
of the installation. | 
90-13.1. Permission to Cover Work. It shall be
unlawful for any person to lath over, seal, cover, or conceal any
electrical wiring or other electrical equipment for the installation
of which a permit is required by Section 90-12.2 until such electric
wiring or other electrical equipment shall have been inspected and
approved by the Inspector. The Inspector shall have the power to remove,
or to require the removal of, any obstruction which prevents the proper
inspection of any electrical equipment. | 
Inspection and Approval Required. | 
(a) All electric wiring, as defined in this part,
for which a permit is required shall be inspected and approved by
the Department of Building and Safety before being energized or used. | 
(b) No person shall use, operate, or maintain, or
cause or permit to be used, operated, or maintained, any such electric
wiring until such inspection and approval. | 
(c) No serving agency shall furnish or supply, or
cause or permit to be furnished or supplied, electric energy to any
such electric wiring until such inspection and approval. | 
(d) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed
to prohibit the temporary use of electric energy when and as specifically
provided in Section 90-14. | 
(e) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed
to prohibit the inspection of any electric wiring even though no permit
is required therefor. | 
(f) If approval is withheld, a written notification
showing the date and the location of the defect in the work, with
the signature of the inspector, shall be sent to the permittee. Failure
of the permittee to make such corrections within 10 days after notification
thereof shall be sufficient cause for refusal to issue any further
permits to such permittee until such corrections have been made to
the satisfaction of the Electrical Inspector. Requests for reinspection
shall be made promptly after corrections have been completed. | 
(g) Approval of rough wiring shall be withheld until
the rough plumbing has been inspected and approved. | 
Inspection of New Work. | 
(a) No person shall conceal, enclose, or cover,
or cause or permit to be concealed, enclosed, or covered, any portion
of any electric wiring in any manner which will interfere with or
prevent the inspection and approval thereof. | 
(b) Any portion of any floor, ceiling, wall, partition,
roof, finish, or other obstruction whatsoever which renders impracticable
the making of a complete and thorough inspection of electric wiring
shall be removed upon notice (either verbal or in writing) so to do
and shall be kept removed until such electric wiring has been inspected
and approved by the Electrical Inspector. | 
(c) The provisions of this section shall not apply
to finished work nor to conductors inserted in conduit or other wiring
enclosures. | 
(d) Before the final inspection of any electrical
wiring, all plaster, concrete, or other foreign material shall be
thoroughly removed from every box and wiring enclosure, and not less
than six inches of jointless conductors shall extend out of each lighting
outlet box for future connections thereto, except when conductors
are intended to loop through the lamp holder. | 
(e) In any case where one or more taped joints are
found not soldered at the time of their inspection, the inspector
may require every joint for such electric wiring to be left untapped
until the inspection and approval thereof. | 
(f) Fixtures of appliances shall not be connected
to electric wiring until the rough wiring has been inspected and approved,
except as otherwise satisfactory to the Department of Building and
Safety. | 
(g) All such wiring shall be free from grounds,
shorts, or other defects before the approval thereof. | 
(h) Whenever any electric wiring has been inspected
and found to comply with the provisions of this part, the inspector
of the Department of Building and Safety shall leave a notice at the
service switch or other suitable place so stating, and the Inspector
shall issue a certificate of inspection, when requested, or service
permit authorizing the connection to the electrical service and the
energizing of the installation. | 
90-13.2. Corrections. All defects shall be corrected
within 10 days after their inspection and notification or within such
other reasonable time as is permitted by the Inspector. Failure to
comply shall be sufficient cause for refusal to issue any further
permit to such permittee until such corrections have been made. | 
90-13.3. Connections. It shall be unlawful to energize,
or cause or permit to be energized, any electrical wiring coming under
provisions of this Article until such electrical wiring shall have
been inspected and approved by the Inspector; provided, however, the
Electrical Inspector may give written temporary permission to furnish
electric current to, or the use of electric current through, any electrical
wiring for a length of time not exceeding 30 days if it appears to
the Electrical Inspector that such electrical wiring may be used safely
for such purposes and that there exists in urgent necessity for such
use. | 
90-13.4. Right of Entry. Whenever it is necessary
to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this Code,
or whenever the Building Official, or his authorized representative,
has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building
or upon any premises any condition which makes such building or premises
unsafe, the Building Official, or his authorized representative, may
enter such building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect
the same or to perform any duty imposed upon the Building Official
by this Code; provided, however, if such building or premises shall
be occupied, he shall first present proper credentials and demand
entry, and if entry of the building or premises is refused him, he
shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other
persons having the charge or control of the building or premises and
demand entry. If such entry is refused, the Building Official, or
his authorized representative, shall have recourse to every remedy
provided by law to secure entry. | 
No owner or occupant or any other person having the charge,
care, or control of any building or premises shall fail or neglect,
after proper demand is made as provided in this section, to properly
permit entry therein by the Building Official, or his authorized representative,
for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to the provisions
of this Code. The Building Official, or his representative, shall
inspect each building or parcel for Code compliance periodically as
required by City, State, or Federal Laws. | 
90-13.5. Reinspections. | 
(a) The Department of Building and Safety is hereby
authorized and empowered to make, at such times and as often as in
its discretion it may seem necessary, a thorough reinspection of the
installation in or on any building, structure, or premises of all
electrical wiring, electric devices, and electrical materials now
installed or that may hereafter be installed within the City of Compton,
and when the installation of any such wiring, device, or material
is found to be in a dangerous or unsafe condition, the person, firm,
corporation, or governmental agency owning, using, or operating the
same shall be notified in writing and shall make the necessary repairs
or changes required to place such wiring, device, or material in a
safe condition to have such work completed within a period of 10 days
after such notice, or within such other reasonable period specified
by the Inspector in such notice, and shall pay such fees as are required
by the provisions of this Article. | 
(b) The Department of Building and Safety is hereby
empowered to disconnect or to order the discontinuance of electrical
service to wiring, devices, or materials found to be defective until
the installation of such wiring, device, or material has been made
safe as directed by the Inspector, and any person, firm, corporation,
political subdivision, or governmental agency ordered to discontinue
such electrical service shall do so within 24 hours after the receipt
of such notice and shall not reconnect such service or allow the same
to be reconnected until notified so to do by the Electrical Inspector. | 
90-13.6. Power to Stop Work. (a) The Building Official,
or his duly authorized electrical inspectors, are hereby authorized
to stop the installation of electric wiring, or the concealment thereof,
whenever such installation or concealment is being done in violation
of this part, until such violation has been corrected. |

electrical inspectors, are hereby authorized to stop the installation
of electric wiring, or the concealment thereof, whenever such installation
or concealment is being done in violation of this part, until such
violation has been corrected. |

and shall be served either in person or by mail upon the person violating
or responsible for the violation of this part to the last known address. | 
(c) No person shall fail, neglect, or refuse to
comply with such notice. | 
90-13.7. Certificates of Completion. | 
(a) Whenever any electric wiring has been inspected
and approved, a certificate of completion therefor shall be issued
on request provided all fees required by this part have been paid
in full. | 
(b) Any certificate of completion may, upon notice,
be revoked and canceled by the Department of Building and Safety if
the Electrical Inspector finds that the electric wiring fails in any
respect to comply with the requirements of this part or that the installation
is unsafe, dangerous, or a hazard to life or property. | 
(c) No person shall use, operate, or energize, or
cause or permit to be used, operated, or energized, any installation,
after the certificate therefor has been revoked, until a new certificate
of completion has been issued therefor by the Department of Building
and Safety. | 
90-13.8. Interpretation of Language. | 
The language used in this part is intended to convey the common
and accepted meaning familiar to the electrical industry. Whenever
any section, or portion thereof, of this part appears to be in conflict
with any other section, or portion thereof, the Electrical Inspector
is hereby authorized to interpret and determine the meaning and intent
of such provisions. | 
90-13.9. General Safety Provisions. | 
(a) It is the intent and purpose of this part to
provide for safe, durable, and reasonable nonhazardous electric installations
and to establish the minimum standards therefor. | 
(b) Irrespective of the specific provisions contained
in this part, or the omission of specific provisions regulating any
electric installation, or portion thereof, the Electrical Inspector
is hereby authorized and empowered to refuse to approve any electric
wiring which, in his opinion, will manifestly fail to carry out the
intents and purposes of this part. |
