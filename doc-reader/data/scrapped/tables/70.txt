Windham Animal Control will advertise adoptable pets on any
available media resource. Each animal that comes into our care, whose
owner is unknown, is advertised, by law, in the local newspaper, for
one day, in the lost and found section; and after the seventh day
has passed and no owner has come forward to claim the pet, animal
control will determine if the animal would be suitable for adoption.
Animal control, in cooperation with pet non-profit groups, has an
obligation to find the best possible home for the pet, provided that
the pet is suitable for adoption. This obligation to the pet is in
conjunction with what is best for the community. New owners are screened
by animal control or designee to make sure proper care of the animal
will take place. This may be done in cooperation with local pet groups.
Making sure that both the new owner and pet are right for each other
is our utmost goal. |
