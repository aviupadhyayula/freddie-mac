Length of individual tile laterals
shall not exceed 75 feet except that in installations where dosing
apparatus is used, a maximum length of 100 feet may be used. | 
If slope of the main header exceeds
one foot per 100 feet, provision shall be made for reducing the velocity
of the septic-tank effluent ahead of the seepage system by properly
located and constructed distribution box or drop-manhole construction. | 
Depth of lateral inverts below ground
surface should preferably be between 12 inches and 24 inches, but
depths up to 36 inches or greater may be used if warranted by conditions
of topography or more favorable absorption capacity of soil at that
depth. |

For cesspools, a pit about one foot
square shall be dug. This should extend to the depth of the proposed
cesspool. For tile fields, the pit may be about one foot square and
dug to a depth of the proposed trenches, usually 18 to 30 inches.
Before observations are made the pit shall be thoroughly wet down
by filling it to a depth of at least 12 inches or more. The pit shall
then be refilled with water to a depth of 12 inches or more, and the
rate of drop of water measured for a period of 30 to 60 minutes under
normal conditions. The minimum uniform rate of drop should be used
in calculating seepage areas. When tests are made, consideration should
be given to the finished grade of building sites, so that results
will correspond to the absorptive value of the soil in which leaching
systems will be constructed. In investigating soil conditions for
a large area, test pits may have to be dug at a rate of one per acre
or even one per lot. Also in investigating soil conditions for a large
area, more than one deep test pit is frequently desirable in that
this may disclose available good seepage soil below normal depths.
Where the observed drop is at a rate faster than one inch in three
minutes (coarse sand or gravel), the soil shall be considered as Class
A; where the rate is slower than one inch in three minutes and faster
than one inch in 10 minutes (fine sand or light sandy loam), the soil
shall be considered as Class B; where the rate is slower than one
inch in 10 minutes and faster than one inch in 30 minutes (clay with
some sand, gravel or silt; not for very tight soils), the soil shall
be considered as Class C; where the rate is slower than one inch in
30 minutes, the soil shall be considered as Class D and special consideration
is needed to avoid nuisance conditions. In some Class D soils it may
be impossible or impracticable to construct a subsurface method for
the disposal of sewage. |

Leaching cesspools may be preferable
where the amount of area is limited or where porous soil is at a greater
depth than can be secured by tile fields. They are not recommended
where ground water may interfere with their operation, or where soil
of better seepage quality is found at shallow depth. |
