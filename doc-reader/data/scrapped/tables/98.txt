 | Example 1: When a space has two 10-ton systems
with each having an independent duct system, the contractor may design
these two systems since each system is less than 15 tons. | 
 | Example 2: Consider a small single story office
building, which consists of six individual offices where each office
has a single three-ton package air conditioning heat pump. The six
heat pumps are connected to a single water-cooling tower. The cost
of the entire heating, ventilation and air conditioning work is $47,000
and the office building accommodates fewer than 100 persons. | 
 | Note: It was further clarified by the commission
that the limiting criteria of 100 persons and $50,000 apply to the
building occupancy load and the cost of the total air-conditioning
system of the building. |

 | Disclosure Statement | 
 | State law requires asbestos abatement to be
done by licensed contractors. You have applied for a permit under
an exemption to that law. The exemption allows you, as the owner of
your property, to act as your own asbestos abatement contractor even
though you do not have a license. You must supervise the construction
yourself. You may move, remove or dispose of asbestos-containing materials
on a residential building where you occupy the building and the building
is not for sale or lease, or the building is a farm outbuilding on
your property. If you sell or lease such building within one year
after the asbestos abatement is complete, the law will presume that
you intended to sell or lease the property at the time the work was
done, which is a violation of this exemption. You may not hire an
unlicensed person as your contractor. Your work must be done according
to all local, state and federal laws and regulations, which apply
to asbestos abatement projects. It is your responsibility to make
sure that people employed by you have licenses required by state law
and by county or City ordinances. |
