The purpose of residential subdivision signs is to identify
the name of a subdivision, provided the subdivision is not an infill
project within an established neighborhood. They are usually monument
signs or wall signs placed on a wall feature in a landscaped open
space area at the entry of the development. |

Shopping center identification signs should be compatible with
the design theme of the development. They may identify multiple tenants,
but larger shopping centers with more than five tenants should avoid
listing individual tenants, other than the project anchors, to avoid
sign clutter. The sign structure should contain elements of the design
theme of the buildings in the center. |

Signage Guidelines
Projecting signs are attached to a building face and project
out perpendicular to the building wall. Projecting signs are very
effective when oriented to pedestrians on the sidewalk level. Appropriate
materials include wood and metal with carved or applied lettering,
or any other material that is architecturally compatible with the
building that the sign is attached to. Multiple projecting signs should
not be installed within 10 feet of each other if on the same property
and should be separated from projecting signs on adjacent properties
by 10 feet to insure proper visibility. |

Freestanding post signs are primarily used to identify office
uses, especially where a former residence has been converted into
an office. They are similar to monument signs, except they do not
have a base other than the support posts, they usually have a single
sign face, and they are usually oriented parallel to the sidewalk
instead of perpendicular. The colors and materials used for the sign
must be compatible with the associated building design. Lettering
should be carved, routed or applied as opposed to painted on a flat
board. |

Signage Guidelines
Monument signs are typically used where building setbacks, orientation
or design make it difficult to provide other types of signage, such
as wall signs, that are plainly visible to people that are trying
to identify a use. Monument signs have a solid base that the sign
face is installed upon. These signs should be designed so that the
style of the sign and its base are consistent with the architecture
of the buildings on the site. They are typically oriented perpendicular
to the adjacent street and sidewalk and have a maximum of two parallel
sign faces. Monument signs provide opportunities for landscaping to
enhance their appearance. |

Signage Guidelines
Wall signs include most types of signage that are attached to
the face of a building wall. These include channel letters made out
of wood, metal or plastic. Wall signs may be painted on a wall, or
on a board that is attached to a wall. Wall signs should be oriented
to achieve balanced composition and harmony with other architectural
elements of a building facade. Wall signs should be placed on a flat
building surface and should not be placed over or otherwise obscure
architectural building features. |

Hanging signs, or suspended signs, are used to help define entries
and identify business names to pedestrians. They are small and can
hang over a building entry if the appropriate clearance is provided.
Hanging signs can be particularly useful for storefronts that have
multiple tenants. |

to window shoppers on the sidewalk, as opposed to vehicles passing
by. Window signs should be limited to small graphics and text that
serve to frame a window or to provide information. A window sign should
