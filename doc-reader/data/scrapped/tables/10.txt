AN ACT CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
A POLICE RETIREMENT FUND IN THE TOWN OF BRANFORD. | 
SECTION 1 — The
Town of Branford is authorized to establish a police retirement fund.
The board of police commissioners and the first selectman of said
town shall be ex-officio[1] trustees of said fund. Said board shall have power to
make such rules and regulations as may be necessary for the administration
of said fund, and shall appoint a clerk of said fund and define his
duties and supervise, by and with the advice of the board of finance
of said town, the investment and reinvestment of said fund in such
investments and in the same manner as funds held in trust funds may
be invested. | 
SECTION 2 — Regular
members of the department shall be eligible to participate in this
fund but supernumeraries, school guards and auxiliary police are not
to be considered regular members and are not eligible to participate
in this fund nor receive any benefits from it except as provided in
section 8 herein. | 
SECTION 3 — Each
regular member of the police department of the Town of Branford upon
the effective date of this act shall become a participating member
of said retirement fund unless on or before thirty days after this
act shall become effective, he sends a written notice to the police
commissioners of said town stating he does not desire to become a
member. The years of service of those who are regular members of the
department upon the effective date of this act shall count for retirement,
but after the effective date, only years of service while participating
in the fund shall be counted toward retirement. | 
SECTION 4 — Said
fund shall consist of all bequests or donations made to the police
department of said town or to the trustees of said fund; all moneys
or property presented to any participating regular member of said
department because of special or meritorious services, except such
as by vote of said board may be retained by such participating regular
member; quarterly or monthly assessments upon the salaries of any
such participating regular member not to exceed five percent per annum,
as the trustees shall determine; such sums of money as are appropriated
by the board of finance of said town for said fund; money realized
from the sale of lost, abandoned, or forfeited property in the hands
of the police department and any unclaimed money remaining in the
hands of such department for a period of one year or more, the owner
of which is unknown, and which property does not by law escheat to
the state. | 
SECTION 5 — The
treasurer of the Town of Branford shall be treasurer of said fund.
He shall receive, disburse, invest or reinvest said funds as the trustees,
by and with the advice of the board of finance, direct. Said treasurer
shall, annually, on or before the second Monday of October, make a
report to said board of the account of said fund in his hands and
the manner in which the same is invested, with a statement of the
receipts and disbursements for the year preceding the first day of
September, and said report shall be published by the selectmen in
the annual report Said treasurer shall give such bond for the security
of said fund and for the faithful performance of his duty as the trustees
shall require. | 
SECTION 6. | 
a.  When any participating
regular member of the police department of said town has served for
a period of twenty-five years or more as a regular member of said
police department and shall have attained the age of fifty-five years,
he shall, upon his request in writing, be retired by the board of
police commissioners and, when he is so retired, the trustees of the
police retirement fund shall thereupon pay to such member, during
his life, a sum equal to one-half of his annual salary at the time
of his retirement, or one-half of the highest annual salary earned
by said participating regular member during the five years next preceding
the time of his retirement, whichever sum is greater, in monthly instalments;[2] provided no such participating regular member so retired
shall receive less than two thousand dollars per annum. In addition
thereto any such participating regular member of the police department
who has served more than twenty-five years in the police department
shall receive an additional two percent of his basic salary at the
time of his retirement for each year over and above said twenty-five
years of service, but in no event shall his pension exceed two-thirds
of his basic salary at the time of his retirement. Social security
benefits being received by the participating regular member shall
first be credited against the total pension due. | 
b.  When any participating
regular member of the police department of the Town of Branford shall,
in the regular performance of police duty and without wilful cause
or wanton misconduct on his part, have become totally and permanently
incapacitated for further police duty, the board of police commissioners
shall cause such participating regular member of the police department
to be examined by three reputable physicians, one to be selected by
such member, one to be selected by the board of police commissioners
and the third to be chosen by two physicians selected as hereinbefore
set forth; and, if at least two of such physicians shall certify,
in writing, that such participating regular member of the police department
so examined is so incapacitated for further police duty, said board
of police commissioners shall place such participating regular member
of the police department on the retirement list, and the trustees
of the police retirement fund shall thereupon pay to such participating
regular member of the police department so retired, during his life,
while so incapacitated a sum equal to one-half of his annual salary
at the time of his retirement, or one-half of the highest annual salary
earned by said member during the five years next preceding the time
of his retirement, whichever sum is greater, in monthly installments;
provided no such member so retired shall receive less than two thousand
dollars per annum. In addition thereto any such participating regular
member who has served more than twenty-five years in the police department
shall receive an additional two percent of his basic salary at the
time of his retirement for each year over and above said twenty-five
years of service, but in no event shall his pension exceed two-thirds
of his basic salary at the time of his retirement. The board of police
commissioners may from time to time cause such member to be reexamined
in the same manner as provided herein for the original examination,
and so long as the physicians continue to certify that such member
remains totally and permanently incapacitated for police duty, said
payments shall continue. Social security benefits, and any compensation
under the provisions of the general statutes as amended relating to
workmen's compensation, if being received by the participating member
shall first be credited against the total pension due. | 
c.  When any participating
regular member of the police department attains sixty-five years of
age, the board of police commissioners shall place such participating
regular member of the police department on the retirement list, and
the trustees of the police retirement fund shall thereupon pay to
such participating regular member of the police department so retired,
during his life, a sum equal to one-half of his annual salary at the
time of his retirement, or one-half of the highest annual salary earned
by said participating regular member during the five years next preceding
the time of his retirement, whichever sum is greater, in monthly installments;
provided no such member so retired shall receive less than two thousand
dollars per annum. In addition thereto any such member who has served
more than twenty-five years in the police department shall receive
an additional two percent of his basic salary at the time of his retirement
for each year over and above the said twenty-five years of service,
but in no event shall his pension exceed two-thirds of his basic salary
at the time of his retirement. Social security benefits, if being
received by the participating regular member, shall first be credited
against the total pension due. | 
SECTION 7 — The
board of finance of said town shall, when making up recommendations
for appropriations for the various departments of said town for each
year, appropriate such sum or sums as are needed to carry out the
purposes of this act. The selectmen of said town are authorized, on
or before the first day of November in each year, to pay to the treasurer
of the police retirement fund, the money so appropriated by said board
of finance. | 
SECTION 8 — The
widow of any participating member, who is in active service at the
time of his death, and qualified to receive benefits under section
6 of this act, at the time of his death, shall receive, until her
death or remarriage, a monthly sum equal to one-half of the monthly
pension for which such member had qualified, but if such member was
retired, the widow shall receive a monthly sum equal to one-half of
the monthly pension being received by such member at the time of his
death. There shall be paid to the widow of a participating regular
member who has not qualified for pension benefits and to the widow
or widower of supernumeraries and school guards hired by the Town,
who shall have been killed while in the actual performance of duty
or shall have died from the proximate effects of any injury sustained
while in the actual discharge of such duty, irrespective of the length
of service of such member at the time of his death or failure to participate
in said fund, a monthly sum equal to one-fourth of the monthly salary
being earned by said member at the time of his or her death. In any
of the above cases, upon the death of such widow or widower before
or after remarriage, leaving a child or children of such deceased
member, under the age of eighteen years, the board of police commissioners,
by a majority vote, may cause to be paid monthly, to the legally appointed
guardian of such child or children for his or their use and benefit,
a sum or sums not exceeding in the aggregate the amount hereinbefore
provided to be received by such widow or widower, and may, from time
to time, apportion such sums between or among such children as it
may deem best provided, as each such child arrives at the age of eighteen
years, the payments to such child shall cease. Any compensation under
the provisions of the general statutes relating to workmen's compensation
and any social security benefits being received by such widow, widower
or children shall first be credited against the total pension due
said widow, widower or children. As used in this section, the term
"widow," in reference to a participating regular member, shall mean
the surviving wife of such member who was living with him at the time
of his death or, if not so living with him, was absent by reason of
his fault, and who, if such member was retired was married to him
prior to his retirement and the term "widow or widower," in reference
to a supernumerary or school guard shall mean the surviving spouse
of such supernumerary or guard who was living with him or her at the
time of his or her death or, if not so living with him or her, was
absent by reason of his or her fault. The term "child or children,"
as used in this section, shall be limited in its meaning to the child
or children born, either before or after the death of such participating
regular member, supernumerary or guard to such member, supernumerary
or guard and his or her spouse, provided if any such participating
regular member was retired, such wife shall have been married to him
prior to his retirement from such department. | 
SECTION 9 — All
pensions herein provided for shall be based on the salaries being
paid at the time of retirement, and in the event of an increase in
the salaries of the positions covered by this act, all pensions then
being paid thereunder shall be increased to the amount that said pensions
would have been had said increase been in effect at the time of his
retirement. | 
SECTION 10 — Upon
termination of the services of a participating regular member for
any cause before qualifying for any retirement benefit, such member's
contributions to the pension fund with interest thereon at the rate
to be determined by the trustees to the date of termination shall
be returned to the member or his designated beneficiary or estate. | 
SECTION 11 — The
board may enter into a contract with any insurance company authorized
to transact business in Connecticut to insure the entire police retirement
system or such portion thereof as the board shall deem advisable;
provided any such contract, before actually being consummated, shall
be approved by a majority vote of the board of selectmen. All premiums
paid to any insurance company under this section shall be paid out
of the funds received by said board from members and from the Town,
as hereinbefore provided. | 
SECTION 12 — The
right of any person to a pension or to the return of contributions,
any benefit or right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions
of this act, and the cash and securities held under this act, shall
be exempt from any state or municipal tax, and exempt from levy and
sale, garnishment, attachment or any other process, and shall be unassignable. | 
SECTION 13 — The
provisions of this act may be amended at any time by the Town of Branford
at a town meeting specially called for that purpose, provided such
amendment shall be in accordance with requirements and procedure established
by the general statutes concerning local action on charters and special
acts, as the same may be from time to time amended, but such amendment
shall not adversely affect the rights of those members who, at the
date of adoption thereof, had already retired, reached their normal
retirement date or were entitled to pension benefits hereunder for
retirement by reason of accidental disability nor to those persons
described in section 8 of this act who were entitled to benefits hereunder.
In the event of amendment, the rights of participating regular members
who have not retired or reached their normal or accidental disability
retirement date shall be as provided by this act as amended. |

such appropriation and to lay a special tax to meet the same; but

so recommended shall be submitted by the board of selectmen to a special
town meeting called for that purpose, and said special town meeting
shall have the power to decrease the appropriations or any item thereof,

special town meeting may vote not to make such appropriation or levy
such special tax, but in no case shall any special town meeting have
