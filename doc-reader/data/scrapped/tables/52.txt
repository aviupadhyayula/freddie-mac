An Act Authorizing the Extension of Water Lines and the
Installation of Water Pipes by the Town of Plainville and the Assessment
Against Property Benefitted Thereby | 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in
General Assembly convened. | 
SECTION 1. Whenever in the opinion of the Town
Council of the Town of Plainville, public necessity and convenience
require the extension of any water main, it shall first ascertain
that the Plainville Water Company does not intend to make such extension.
Upon written notice from said company that it does not intend to make
such extension, the Council shall give at least 10 days written notice
of the proposed extension to said company and the owner or owners
of the land and buildings against which the cost of such water mains
may be assessed and of the time and place when objections to such
extensions will be heard by said Council, and notice thereof shall
also be published in a newspaper published in the Town of Plainville.
If after such hearing said Council finds that public necessity and
convenience require the extension of such water main, it may vote
to make such extension. | 
SECTION 2. Said Council may open the ground in
any streets, lanes, avenues, highways and public grounds within said
Town for the purpose of laying water mains and installing hydrants,
building services and such other works as may be necessary in accordance
with this act, and may reopen such streets, lanes, avenues, highways
and public grounds as may be necessary to repair such works from time
to time, provided the same are left in as good condition as before
installing or repairing such works, for so long as said Town owns
such installation. To repair all defects or injuries to such areas
which are caused by its use of the same for the purposes of this act,
said Town may carry and conduct any aqueduct or other works to be
made or constructed by it or under or over any watercourse, street,
highway, private way or public grounds, provided it restores the same
as speedily as possible to as good condition as before the laying
and constructing of such works. | 
SECTION 3. Said Council shall assess against the
land and buildings found to be specially benefited and to abut upon
the road, street or highway or easement under which a water main is
laid, a share of the cost of such water main according to such rule
as said Council may adopt and said Council may, in its discretion,
make reasonable allowances in the case of properties having a frontage
on more than one road or street or highway or easement, frontage on
a curve, or when for any reason the situation of the frontage of the
property shall require such allowance; provided no property shall
be assessed for a greater amount than the special benefit to accrue
to such property. All property benefited by the laying of such water
mains shall together bear as nearly as possible the total cost of
the laying and construction of such water main. Upon the final completion
of the construction of any such water main, said Council shall give
written notice thereof to the owners of the land and buildings assessed
therefor and that the assessments are due and payable on the date
of such notice. Any such owner may pay the amount of any such assessment
within 30 days from the date of such notice without the addition of
any interest charge, or shall, within said 30 days, notify said Council
of his election to pay the amount so assessed in equal installments,
the first installment to be paid within said period of 30 days, and
subsequent installments to be paid in substantially equal annual installments
beginning not later than one year and ending not later than 10 years
from the date of said notice. All assessments unpaid after 30 days
from the date of such notice, unless the owner assessed had elected
installment payments, shall bear interest at the rate provided by
Section 12-146 of the General Statutes, as amended, for delinquent
taxes from the date of such notice. If such owner has elected installment
payments, all unpaid balances shall bear interest at such rate as
the Council determines, not to exceed such rate as is permitted pursuant
to Section 7-253 of the General Statutes, as amended, provided the
accrued interest on any such installment shall be payable concurrently
with each such installment. The amount so assessed shall be a lien
upon the lands and buildings against which it was assessed, which
lien shall commence and attach to said land and buildings from the
time of the passage by said Council of the vote to extend the water
main, provided a certificate of such lien, describing the property
on which the same exists, which description may be by reference to
street address and to volume and page in the land records of the Town
Clerk at which fuller description is found, and the amount thereof,
shall be filed with the Town Clerk of the Town of Plainville, such
certificate to be signed by the Town Manager or other authorized representative
of said council and to be filed within one year after the assessment
or charge shall have become payable. The Tax Collector of the Town
of Plainville may collect such assessment in accordance with any mandatory
provision of the General Statutes for the collection of property taxes,
and the municipality may recover any such assessment in a civil action
against any person liable therefor. Whenever any person has become
delinquent in the payment of any installment and has paid all such
past-due installments together with any interest or other charges,
the Town Council shall permit such person to pay any remaining installments
without additional penalty, except for subsequent default, in accordance
with the original installment schedule. | 
SECTION 4. To put into operation any water main
extension constructed by said Town, said Council may purchase water
from the Plainville Water Company or from any other water supplier.
Said Council may set the rates to be charged the users of water purchased
by it and delivered through mains constructed by it, provided such
rates are no higher than necessary to cover the cost of the water,
the maintenance of the mains and the administration of such water
supply service and may bill the users of such water and collect such
bills in the same manner as any property tax is collected. Any person
aggrieved by any charge for connection with or for the use of such
a water main may appeal to the court of common pleas for the county
or judicial district wherein the municipality is located and shall
bring such appeal to the next return day of said court, or the next
but one. The judgement of the court shall be final. | 
SECTION 5. If after public hearing said Council
finds it to be in the interest of the residents of the Town of Plainville
to lease or convey water mains constructed by said Town to the Plainville
Water Company or its successors or assignees, said Council may so
lease or convey its rights and interest in such water mains to said
company upon mutually acceptable terms. |
