be provided during construction, remodeling or demolition activities
in accordance with the International Plumbing Code. |

waste, trash, and litter. During all construction activities, the

of suitable size and design to hold and confine trash, scraps, and
other construction and demolition waste created or accumulated on
the site, which might be blown from the site. All such construction
