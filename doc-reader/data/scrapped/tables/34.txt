SECTION 902
INSPECTIONS | 
902.1 Scope. The Code Official
is hereby authorized and directed to make periodic inspections within
the purview of this chapter and such inspections as are required by
a code compliance program of the Town of Mansfield, by and with the
consent of the owner, occupant or person in charge, to determine the
condition of dwellings, dwelling units, rooming units and premises
within this Town for the purpose of determining compliance with the
provisions of this chapter or this code. Occupants may also request
inspections under this chapter or this code. | 
A. For the purpose of making such inspections,
the Code Official, with the consent of the owner, occupant or person
in charge, is hereby authorized to enter, examine and survey all dwellings,
dwelling units, rooming units and premises at such time mutually satisfactory
to and agreed upon by the Code Official and the owner or occupant
of a dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit or the person in charge
thereof. Such inspection, examination or survey shall not have for
its purpose the undue harassment of the owner or occupant, and such
inspection, examination or survey shall be made so as to cause the
least amount of inconvenience to said owner or occupant, consistent
with an efficient performance of the duties of the Code Official.
To further ensure that the policy of this chapter, which is to achieve
compliance through cooperation of owners and occupants, shall be successfully
maintained, it shall be the practice of the Code Official, whenever
practicable, to provide reasonable advance notice to owners and/or
occupants of projected special inspections or inspections of a routine
nature. Ultimately, no owner or occupant of a residential rental housing
unit or rooming unit may unreasonably withhold from the Code Official
consent to access the premises for the purpose of performing any inspection
authorized by this code. | 
B. The occupant of each dwelling, dwelling
unit, rooming unit or premises, or the person in charge thereof, upon
presentation by the Code Official of his/her proper credentials, may
give the Code Official entry to the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming
unit or premises and free access to every part thereof. | 
C. Whenever an owner, occupant or person
in charge of a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises shall
deny the Code Official right of entry for the purpose of inspection,
examination or survey, the Code Official shall not enter until he/she
presents a duly issued search warrant or other written authorization
describing the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises to
the owner, occupant or person in charge thereof. | 
D. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to preclude the entry of the Code Official at any time when, in his/her
judgment, an emergency tending to create an immediate danger to the
public welfare or safety exists, or when such entry is requested by
the owner, occupant or person in charge of the dwelling, dwelling
unit, rooming unit or premises, or when the Code Official presents
a duly issued search warrant to said owner or occupant or person in
charge thereof. | 
902.2 Access to remedy. Per Connecticut
General Statutes Section 47a-16, every occupant of a residential rental
housing unit or rooming unit shall not unreasonably withhold from
the owner thereof, or his/her agent or employee, consent to access
any part of such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit, or its premises,
for the purpose of making such repairs or alterations as are necessary
to effect compliance with the provisions of this chapter or with any
lawful rule or regulation adopted or any lawful order issued pursuant
to the provisions of this chapter. |
