§ 102-81      Blocks and Lots (RSIS).

[[CONTENT]]
A. General. The layout of blocks and lots shall be designed to:
(1) Be compatible with the lot and block patterns established in theneighborhood, as appropriate.
(2) Minimize negative impacts to the natural and manmade environments.
(3) Provide for a well-designed system for circulation and access.
(4) Provide a suitable amount of land on each lot that will enable appropriatedevelopment according to this chapter without undue environmentalimpact.
B. Block length. No block shall exceed one thousand (1,000) feet inlength.
C. Lots to conform with zoning requirements. Whenever a new lot is formedfrom a part of any other lot or lots, the assembly or separation shallbe effected in such a manner as not to impair any of the requirementsof this chapter. No subdivision shall be permitted which results ina change in area, width, or front, side or rear yard that fails tocomply in every respect with the required provisions of the districtin which it is located.
D. Lot shape. Lots shall be shaped to enable proper use, maintenanceof and access to the lot, and in keeping with the planned future developmentof the area, as indicated in the Master Plan and zoning regulations.
Insofar as is practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles tostraight streets and radial to curved streets.
E. Lots to front on street. Each lot must front upon an approved streetat least fifty (50) feet in width, or such greater width that maybe required herein or by the Borough Master Plan, Official Map orby any other law.
F. Suitability of lots for development. The Board may, after adequateinvestigation, withhold approval of any lot which in its opinion isnot suitable for its intended use due to factors such as, but notlimited to, rock formations, flooding, wetlands, soil conditions,presence of hazardous materials, excessive slopes, lot shape, etc.
The Board may require and the applicant may propose, as appropriate,revision to the proposed lot layout to mitigate the above concernsby:
(1) Eliminating unsuitable lots and merging same with adjacent lots.
(2) Dedicating unsuitable lots to the Borough for conservation and/orrecreational purposes.
(3) Providing for restrictions on the future development of unsuitablelots by conservation easements, deed restrictions, common open spaceownership or other restrictions.
G. Numbering of lots. Whenever a lot or lots shall be subdivided ormerged, none of the lots shall retain the lot numbers that existedbefore such subdivision or merger. By way of example and not limitation,the lots resulting from a subdivision of a lot 6 into two (2) lotsmay be numbered 6.01 and 6.02, but not 6 and 6.01. Similarly, thelot resulting from a merger of lots 5 and 6 into one (1) lot may benumbered lot 5.01 or 6.01, but not 5 or 6.[Added 12-17-01 by Ord. 2118]

Permitted uses - public property. The public property is definedas the area between the buildings located on either side of Division
Street which consists of decorative stamped concrete. The area isdivided into three (3) zones; sidewalk, transition area and travelway. The sidewalk is approximately twelve (12) to fifteen (15) feetwide and terminates at the running bond (i.e. rumble strip) wherethe removable bollards are located. The transition area is the four
(4) foot wide zone between the rumble strip/bollard and edge of thetravel way. The travel way is defined as a twelve (12) foot striplocated in the center of the multi-use surface.
The permitted uses are per zone (i.e. sidewalk, transition areaand travel way) and cover the following two (2) scenarios; multi-usesurface used as a pedestrian plaza; and used for both pedestriansand automobiles.
The permitted uses are as follows:
(a)
Sidewalks.
[1]
Outdoor dining for adjacent restaurants and coffee shops (Planning
Board approval required);
[2]
Street vendors, merchants located within or not within the Arts
District (DSA approval);
[3]
Art installations (DSA and Council approval);
[4]
Kiosks for teaching/demonstrating art (DSA approval);
[5]
Display informational kiosks (DSA approval);
[6]
Street performers and performing artists (DSA approval);
[7]
Farmers market (DSA approval);
[8]
Street fairs (DSA approval);
[9]
Street musicians, acoustic/non-amplified music (DSA approval);
[10] Street musicians, amplified music (DSA approval).
The requirements for amplified music are greater than for acoustic
(non-amplified) music as the impact of the music on the community,merchants, residents and patrons could be greater due potential increasedvolume of the music. This is a general statement as it is not truein all cases, for example a marching band generates considerable volumeof music and is not amplified;
[11] Art exhibits (DSA approval);
[12] Classrooms for performing arts and "Clean Arts"
(printmaking, painting/drawing, photography, computer digital designcenter, cooking and textile/weaving/knitting), DSA approval;
[13] Sculptors, painters, stained glass artisans, handmadejewelry, frame making and any use permitted in private property locatedwithin the Arts District Overlay Zone (DSA approval).
If the street is being used by automobiles, the sidewalk usesmust be located a minimum of six (6) feet from the rumble strip/bollardsto allow sufficient room for pedestrians.
With the exception of outdoor dining, the use of the publicproperty must be approved by DSA prior to its use. The DSA will facilitateand regulate the use of the public property within the Arts District.
(b)
Transition area/travel way. The Fire Chief and Board of Engineersrequests that the transition area and travel way be free from objectsthat are too heavy to be moved by one (1) person when the street isclosed. As an option, heavy objects may be placed on wheels so thatthey can be moved by one (1) person. Heavy or permanent items shouldremain in the sidewalk area. Based on the guidance provided by the
Fire Chief and Board of Engineers, the proposed uses of the transitionarea and travel way are as follows:
[1]
The transition area may be a continuation of the sidewalk uses
(as described above), with the exception of sidewalk cafes/restaurants,if the travel way remains free from obstructions and is used for pedestrianmovement (when the street is closed). Therefore, a twelve (12) footwide strip down the middle of the street will be used for pedestrianmovement. The items placed on transition area must meet the requirementsof the Fire Chief and Board of Engineers, thus, permanent heavy itemscannot be placed on the transition area. Regardless of how the streetis used, the sidewalk cafes/restaurants are limited to the sidewalkarea and cannot extend into the transition area or travel way.
[2]
The transition area and travel way can be used for the sameuses of the sidewalks if the sidewalks remain open for pedestrianmovement and the requirements of the Fire Chief/Board of Engineersare addressed.
[3]
In summary, the sidewalk and transition area can be used forpermitted activities while the travel way remains open or the travelway/transition area can be used for permitted activities while thesidewalks remain open for pedestrian traffic (as long as the Fire
Chief/Board of Engineers requirements are met). Given that the widthof the sidewalk and transition area (thirty-two (32) to thirty-eight
(38) feet if both sides are used) is much wider than the combinedwidth of the travel way and transition area twenty (20) feet, thepreferred layout is to use the sidewalks and transition areas forpermitted uses.
[4]
During special events the entire width of the multi-use surface
(building face to building face) may be used upon addressing the requirementsof Borough Officials, Fire Chief/Board of Engineers and Somerville
Rescue Squad.
[5]
The programming of events and uses of the sidewalk, transitionarea and travel way shall be by the DSA with the exception of sidewalkcafés which require Planning Board approval or Borough Councilapproval for the permanent/semi-permanent installation of items onthe sidewalk.

[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 149A-1      Scope and purpose.

[[CONTENT]]
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutantreduction shall be achieved through the use of stormwater managementmeasures, including green infrastructure best management practices
(GI BMPs) and nonstructural stormwater management strategies. GI BMPsand low-impact development (LID) should be utilized to meet the goalof maintaining natural hydrology to reduce stormwater runoff volume,reduce erosion, encourage infiltration and groundwater recharge, andreduce pollution. GI BMPs and LID should be developed based upon physicalsite conditions and the origin, nature and the anticipated quantity,or amount, of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater management
BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established performance standardsfor water quality, quantity, and groundwater recharge.
B. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls for "major development," as defined below in § 149A-2.
C. Applicability.
(1) This chapter shall be applicable to the following major developments:
(a)
Nonresidential major developments; and
(b)
Aspects of residential major developments that are not preemptedby the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This chapter shall also be applicable to all major developments undertakenby the Borough of Somerville.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
(1) Development approvals issued pursuant to this chapter are to be consideredan integral part of development approvals and do not relieve the applicantof the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals foractivities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chaptershall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion ofthe public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annulany other ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provisionof law except that, where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictionsdifferent from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation,or other provision of law, the more restrictive provisions or higherstandards shall control.

H. Whenever the stormwater management design includes one or more BMPsthat will infiltrate stormwater into subsoil, the design engineershall assess the hydraulic impact on the groundwater table and designthe site, so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adversehydraulic impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating anaturally or seasonally high water table, so as to cause surficialponding, flooding of basements, or interference with the proper operationof subsurface sewage disposal systems or other subsurface structureswithin the zone of influence of the groundwater mound, or interferencewith the proper functioning of the stormwater management measure itself.
I. Design standards for stormwater management measures are as follows:
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to take into accountthe existing site conditions, including, but not limited to, environmentallycritical areas; wetlands; flood-prone areas; slopes; depth to seasonalhigh water table; soil type, permeability, and texture; drainage areaand drainage patterns; and the presence of solution-prone carbonaterocks (limestone);
(2) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the intake to the outlet structure, as appropriate, and shall have parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with the requirements of § 149A-8C;
(3) Stormwater management measures shall be designed, constructed, andinstalled to be strong, durable, and corrosion-resistant. Measuresthat are consistent with the relevant portions of the Residential
Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 shallbe deemed to meet this requirement;
(4) Stormwater management BMPs shall be designed to meet the minimum safety standards for stormwater management BMPs at § 149A-8; and
(5) The size of the orifice at the intake to the outlet from the stormwatermanagement BMP shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
J. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements of this subchapter, provided the pollutant removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and certified by the Department. Manufactured treatment devices that do not meet the definition of green infrastructure at § 149A-2 may be used only under the circumstances described at § 149A-4O(4).
K. Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the definition of major development at § 149A-2 shall be submitted to the Soil Conservation District for review and approval in accordance with the requirements at § 149A-4O, P, Q and R and any applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control. For purposes of this subsection, "agricultural development" means land uses normally associated with the production of food, fiber, and livestock for sale. Such uses do not include the development of land for the processing or sale of food and the manufacture of agriculturally related products.
L. If there is more than one drainage area, the groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quality, and stormwater runoff quantity standards at § 149A-4P, Q and R shall be met in each drainage area, unless the runoff from the drainage areas converge on site and no adverse environmental impact would occur as a result of compliance with any one or more of the individual standards being determined utilizing a weighted average of the results achieved for that individual standard across the affected drainage areas.
M. Any stormwater management measure authorized under the municipal stormwater management plan or ordinance shall be reflected in a deed notice recorded in the Somerset County Clerk's office. A form of deed notice shall be submitted to the municipality for approval prior to filing. The deed notice shall contain a description of the stormwater management measure(s) used to meet the green infrastructure, groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quality, and stormwater runoff quantity standards at § 149A-4O, P, Q and R and shall identify the location of the stormwater management measure(s) in NAD 1983 State Plane New Jersey FIPS 2900 US Feet or Latitude and Longitude in decimal degrees. The deed notice shall also reference the maintenance plan required to be recorded upon the deed pursuant to § 149A-10B(5). Prior to the commencement of construction, proof that the above required deed notice has been filed shall be submitted to the municipality. Proof that the required information has been recorded on the deed shall be in the form of either a copy of the complete recorded document or a receipt from the Clerk or other proof of recordation provided by the recording office. However, if the initial proof provided to the municipality is not a copy of the complete recorded document, a copy of the complete recorded document shall be provided to the municipality within 180 calendar days of the authorization granted by the municipality.
N. A stormwater management measure approved under the municipal stormwater management plan or ordinance may be altered or replaced with the approval of the municipality, if the municipality determines that the proposed alteration or replacement meets the design and performance standards pursuant to § 149A-4 of this chapter and provides the same level of stormwater management as the previously approved stormwater management measure that is being altered or replaced. If an alteration or replacement is approved, a revised deed notice shall be submitted to the municipality for approval and subsequently recorded with the Somerset County Clerk's office and shall contain a description and location of the stormwater management measure, as well as reference to the maintenance plan, in accordance with Subsection M above. Prior to the commencement of construction, proof that the above required deed notice has been filed shall be submitted to the municipality in accordance with Subsection M above.
O. Green infrastructure standards.
(1) This subsection specifies the types of green infrastructure BMPsthat may be used to satisfy the groundwater recharge, stormwater runoffquality, and stormwater runoff quantity standards.

Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas where recharge wouldbe inconsistent with Department approved remedial action work planor landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for spills of toxicmaterials, such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities;
and
(b)
Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material." "Sourcematerial" means any material(s) or machinery, located at an industrialfacility, that is directly or indirectly related to process, manufacturingor other industrial activities, which could be a source of pollutantsin any industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source materialsinclude, but are not limited to, raw materials; intermediate products;
final products; waste materials; by-products; industrial machineryand fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents that are relatedto process, manufacturing, or other industrial activities that areexposed to stormwater.
Q. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) This subsection contains the minimum design and performance standardsto control stormwater runoff quality impacts of major development.
Stormwater runoff quality standards are applicable when the majordevelopment results in an increase of one-quarter acre or more ofregulated motor vehicle surface.
(2) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the post-constructionload of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater runoff generatedfrom the water quality design storm as follows:
(a)
80% TSS removal of the anticipated load, expressed as an annualaverage, shall be achieved for the stormwater runoff from the netincrease of motor vehicle surface.
(b)
If the surface is considered regulated motor vehicle surfacebecause the water quality treatment for an area of motor vehicle surfacethat is currently receiving water quality treatment either by vegetationor soil, by an existing stormwater management measure, or by treatmentat a wastewater treatment plant is to be modified or removed, theproject shall maintain or increase the existing TSS removal of theanticipated load expressed as an annual average.
(3) The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this requirement. Every major development, including any that discharge into a combined sewer system, shall comply with Subsection Q(2) above, unless the major development is itself subject to a NJPDES permit with a numeric effluent limitation for TSS or the NJPDES permit to which the major development is subject exempts the development from a numeric effluent limitation for TSS.
(4) The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in twohours. Water quality calculations shall take into account the distributionof rain from the water quality design storm, as reflected in Table
4, below. The calculation of the volume of runoff may take into accountthe implementation of stormwater management measures.

(6) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm. In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible, the design of the site shall include green infrastructure BMPs that optimize nutrient removal while still achieving the performance standards in § 149A-4P, Q and R.
(7) In accordance with the definition of "FW1" at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent any increasein stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) The Flood Hazard Area Control Act Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:13-4.1(c)1

(10)
This stormwater runoff quality standards do not apply to theconstruction of one individual single-family dwelling, provided thatit is not part of a larger development or subdivision that has receivedpreliminary or final site plan approval prior to December 3, 2018,and that the motor vehicle surfaces are made of permeable material(s)
such as gravel, dirt, and/or shells.
R. Stormwater runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains the minimum design and performance standardsto control stormwater runoff quantity impacts of major development.
(2) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff calculations at § 149A-5, complete one of the following:
(a)
Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that forstormwater leaving the site, post-construction runoff hydrographsfor the two-, ten-, and 100-year storm events do not exceed, at anypoint in time, the pre-construction runoff hydrographs for the samestorm events;
(b)
Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that thereis no increase, as compared to the pre-construction condition, inthe peak runoff rates of stormwater leaving the site for the two-,ten- and 100-year storm events and that the increased volume or changein timing of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damage at ordownstream of the site. This analysis shall include the analysis ofimpacts of existing land uses and projected land uses assuming fulldevelopment under existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainagearea;
(c)
Design stormwater management measures so that the post-constructionpeak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and 100-year storm events are
50%, 75% and 80%, respectively, of the pre-construction peak runoffrates. The percentages apply only to the post-construction stormwaterrunoff that is attributable to the portion of the site on which theproposed development or project is to be constructed; or
(d)
In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity analysis in accordance with Subsection R(2)(a), (b) and (c) above is required unless the design engineer demonstrates through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the increased volume, change in timing, or increased rate of the stormwater runoff, or any combination of the three will not result in additional flood damage below the point of discharge of the major development. No analysis is required if the stormwater is discharged directly into any ocean, bay, inlet, or the reach of any watercourse between its confluence with an ocean, bay, or inlet and downstream of the first water control structure.
(3) The stormwater runoff quantity standards shall be applied at thesite's boundary to each abutting lot, roadway, watercourse, orreceiving storm sewer system.

§ 149A-5      Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge.

[[CONTENT]]
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the followingmethods:
(a)
The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in Chapters 7, 9, 10, 15 and 16 Part 630, Hydrology National Engineering Handbook, incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented. This methodology is additionally described in Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds (TR-55), dated June 1986, incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented. Information regarding the methodology is available from the Natural Resources Conservation Service website at: https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1044171.pdf or at United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, 220 Davison Avenue, Somerset, New Jersey 08873; or
(b)
The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations. The rational and modified rationalmethods are described in "Appendix A-9 Modified Rational Method" inthe Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey,
January 2014. This document is available from the State Soil Conservation
Committee or any of the Soil Conservation Districts listed at N.J.A.C.
2:90-1.3(a)3. The location, address, and telephone number for each
Soil Conservation District is available from the State Soil Conservation
Committee, PO Box 330, Trenton, New Jersey 08625. The document isalso available at: http://www.nj.gov/agriculture/divisions/anr/pdf/2014NJSoilErosionControlStandardsComplete.pdf.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater recharge, there is a presumption that the pre-construction condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both the NRCS methodology above at § 149A-5A(1)(a) and the Rational and Modified Rational Methods at § 149A-5A(1)(b). A runoff coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover has existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing pre-construction stormwater runoff, the design engineershall account for all significant land features and structures, suchas ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or culverts, that mayreduce pre-construction stormwater runoff rates and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the designengineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/orvolumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to accuratelycompute the rates and volume of impervious cover, urban imperviousarea modifications as described in the NRCS Technical Release 55,
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, or other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater managementmeasure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as definedat N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account theeffects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater managementmeasures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the following:
The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for Evaluating
Groundwater-Recharge Areas in New Jersey, incorporated herein by referenceas amended and supplemented. Information regarding the methodologyis available from the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual; at the New Jersey Geological Survey website at: https://www.nj.gov/dep/njgs/pricelst/gsreport/gsr32.pdfor at New Jersey Geological and Water Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, PO

3.2
FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
A.
Confirm uniform fiber dispersion throughout concrete in accordancewith manufacturer's instructions.
B.
The concrete shall be intergrally dyed, "Smokey Blue" (Brickformcolor 650) or approved equal. The dry intergral concrete color (i.e.
Powdered Color) shall be in compliance with ASTM C 979 and the applicationrate shall be 12.5 lbs. per cubic yard. When the concrete has reachedthe plastic stage desirable for imprinting, Brickform Liquid Releaseor approved equal shall be used between the texture maps and concreteto prevent sticking and concrete buildup. The location of the concreteto be stamped is depicted on the plans. Apply in temperatures between
55 degrees and 80 degrees F. Do not trowel or mix colorless bond breakerinto plastic concrete surface. Press stamping mats in accordance withmanufacturer's instructions into concrete that has reached plasticstage desirable for imprinting. Use the stamping mats to create patternsin concrete as indicated on the drawings. Once the concrete is stamped,the concrete shall be detailed to address all stamp imperfectionsand repair and minor cracks caused by the mats.
The integrally dyed concrete not stamped shall be scored atthe control joints creating a "Tooled Joint Look" using an ultra-earlyentry concrete cutting saw and beveled blade. The 10'x10'
pattern shall be "picture framed" using 3/8' "v" profile bladeby Soft-Cut International, Inc. or approved equal. All control jointsshall be between 2 and 2.66 deep (D/4 and D/3).
The scored concrete shall have a finish texture of "extra smallveronica" texture as produced by Brickform or approved equal for theconcrete located on the outside of the pedestrian crosswalk (Mainand South sides of the crosswalks). The texture of scored concretelocated on the inside of the crosswalks shall be coquina producedby Proline or approved equal. The concrete finished with the customstamp shall have a finish texture of "extra small blue stone" as producedby Brickform or approved equal.
Upon completion of the stamp concrete detailing, the concreteshall be cleaned and all efflorescence, oil, dirt, wax, sealers andcuring compounds shall be removed. The concrete shall be cleaned witha pressure washer and soaps and detergents shall not be used for cleaning.
Dried residue on the surface will prevent the sealer from bonding.
Acid washing shall not be performed. Once the surface is cleaned anddry for at least twenty-four (24) hours the concrete shall be sealedwith Brickform Gem Cure & Seal 1315-350 VOC or approved equal.
Gem Cure and Seal 1315-350 VOC shall be applied when the air temperatureis within 45 and 85 degrees F., apply with a pump sprayer uniformlyat a rate of 250-300 square feet per gallon, avoid heavy spray, puddlingand over saturation. A second coat shall be applied after the firstcoat is tack free. Gem cure should be applied within 24-30 hours ofconcrete stamping but it is imperative to wait until all the waterhas evaporated from the concrete surface, even if it delays the curingfor a short time. Applying the cure and seal over integrally coloredconcrete with excessive moisture at the surface may create discoloration,splotchy areas, blushing and uneven color- if this occurs it shallbe the contractors responsibility to repair the concrete at no additionalcost. The second coat shall be applied a minimum of seventeen (17)
days after the first coat. If the sealer is applied seventy-two (72)
hours or greater after concrete stamping, the second coat of sealercan be applied directly after the first coat has dried.
Prior to applying the sealer the Gem Cure & Seal the sealershall be modified by the addition of Brickform Traction Grip (secondcoat only) and Brickform Matte-Magic (both the initial and secondcoat). Add the contents of the Traction Grip to each five-gallon of
Brickform Gem Seal. The traction grip is an anti-slip micronized powderthat adds texture to sealers. The Brickform Matte-Magic is a liquid,field added, flattening agent addition for the sealer. The originaltopcoat gloss is reduced based on the amount of additive used. A satinfinish is desired, therefore, three to four 8 ounce units shall beadded to each 5 gallon of sealer. A concrete mock up shall be performedto demonstrate that the concrete repair will match the color and finishof the surrounding concrete surface. The actual amount will be determinedbased upon the concrete mock up approved by the Borough.
Prior to sealing the concrete the concrete finish shall be enhancedwith dark grey highlites color hardener as produced by Brickform orapproved equal.
