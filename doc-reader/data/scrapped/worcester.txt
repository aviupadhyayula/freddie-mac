SUBTITLE III	    	Floodplain Management

[[START-PAGE]]

[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ BR 2-301      General provisions.

[[CONTENT]]
(a) Findings. The Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) has identified special flood hazard areas within theboundaries of Worcester County. Special flood hazard areas are subjectto periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmentalservices, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection andrelief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affectthe public health, safety and general welfare. Structures that areinadequately elevated, improperly floodproofed, or otherwise unprotectedfrom flood damage also contribute to flood losses. Worcester County,by resolution, agreed to meet the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program and was accepted for participation in the programon February 15, 1979. As of that date, or as of the initial effectivedate of the Worcester County Flood Insurance Rate Map, all developmentand new construction as defined herein, is to be compliant with theseregulations.
(b) Statutory authorization. The Maryland General
Assembly, in the Annotated Code of Maryland, Land Use Article, Title
4, as from time to time amended, has established as policy of thestate that the orderly development and use of land and structuresrequires comprehensive regulation through the implementation of planningand zoning control, and that planning and zoning controls shall beimplemented by local government in order to, among other purposes,secure the public safety, promote health and general welfare, andpromote the conservation of natural resources. Therefore, the County
Commissioners of Worcester County, Maryland do hereby adopt the followingfloodplain management regulations.
(c) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose ofthese regulations to promote the public health, safety and generalwelfare, and to:
(1)
Protect human life, health and welfare;
(2)
Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practicesin order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future;
(3)
Minimize flooding of water supply and sanitary sewage disposalsystems;
(4)
Maintain natural drainage;
(5)
Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmentalunits and its residents by discouraging unwise design and constructionof development in areas subject to flooding;
(6)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated withflooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(7)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(8)
Minimize damage to public facilities and other utilities suchas water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streetsand bridges;
(9)
Reinforce that those who build in and occupy special flood hazardareas should assume responsibility for their actions;
(10)
Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties withinand near flood-prone areas;
(11)
Provide that the flood storage and conveyance functions of floodplainsare maintained;
(12)
Minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficialfunctions of floodplains;
(13)
Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentallyincompatible; and
(14)
Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) at 44 CFR 59.22, as from time to time amended.
(d) Areas to which these regulations apply. Theseregulations shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within thejurisdiction of Worcester County and identified in § BR
2-301(e).
(e) Basis for establishing special flood hazard areas andbase flood elevations. In the establishment of specialflood hazard areas and base flood elevations, the following shallapply:
(1)
For the purposes of these regulations, the minimum basis forestablishing special flood hazard areas and base flood elevations
(BFEs) is the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Worcester County, Marylandand Incorporated Areas, dated July 16, 2015, or the most recent revisionthereof, and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) (FIRMs)
and all subsequent amendments and revisions to the Flood Insurance
Rate Maps. The Flood Insurance Study and the Flood Insurance Rate
Maps are retained on file and available to the public at the Worcester
County Government Center, Development Review and Permitting Office
(Room 1201), Snow Hill, Maryland.
(2)
Where field surveyed topography or digital topography indicatesthat ground elevations are below the closest applicable base floodelevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazardon the Flood Insurance Rate Maps, the area shall be considered asa special flood hazard area.
(3)
To establish base flood elevations in special flood hazard areasthat do not have such elevations shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, the Floodplain Administrator may provide the best availabledata for base flood elevations, may require the applicant to obtainavailable information from federal, state or other sources, or mayrequire the applicant to establish special flood hazard areas andbase flood elevations as set forth in §§ BR 2-303(c),
(d) and (e).
(f) Abrogation and greater restrictions. Theseregulations are not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing regulationsand ordinances, including subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances,building codes, or any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any otherordinance, the more restrictive shall govern.
(g) Interpretation. Notes referencing publicationsof the Federal Emergency Management Agency refer to the most recentedition of those publications, are intended only as guidance, anddo not bind or alter the authority of the Floodplain Administratorto interpret and apply these regulations. In the interpretation andapplication of these regulations, all provisions shall be:
(1)
Considered a minimum requirement;
(2)
Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
(3)
Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers grantedunder state statutes.
(h) Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degreeof flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonablefor regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineeringconsiderations. Larger floods can and will occur, and flood heightsmay be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulationsdo not imply that land outside of the special flood hazard areas oruses that are permitted within such areas will be free from floodingor flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on thepart of Worcester County, any officer or employee thereof, the Maryland
Department of the Environment (MDE) or the Federal Emergency Management
Agency for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulationsor any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
(i) Severability. Should any section or provisionof these regulations be declared by the courts to be unconstitutionalor invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the regulationsas a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared tobe unconstitutional or invalid.
(j) Short title. This Subtitle shall hereinafterbe referred to as the "Worcester County Floodplain Management Law."

NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP)
The program authorized by the United States Congress in 42
U.S.C. §§ 4001 through 4129, as from time to time amended.
The National Flood Insurance Program makes flood insurance coverageavailable in communities that agree to adopt and enforce minimum regulatoryrequirements for development in areas prone to flooding (see definitionof "special flood hazard area").
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM STATE COORDINATOR
See "Maryland Department of the Environment."
NEW CONSTRUCTION
Structures, including additions and improvements, and theplacement of manufactured homes, for which the start of constructioncommenced on or after February 15, 1979, the initial effective dateof the Worcester County Flood Insurance Rate Map, including any subsequentimprovements, alterations, modifications, and additions to such structures.
NON-TIDAL WATERS OF THE STATE
See "waters of the state." As used in these regulations,
"non-tidal waters of the State" refers to any stream or body of waterwithin the state that is subject to state regulation, including the
"one-hundred-year frequency floodplain of free-flowing waters." COMAR
26.17.04, as from time to time amended, states that "the landwardboundaries of any tidal waters shall be deemed coterminous with thewetlands boundary maps adopted pursuant to Environmental Article,
§ 16-301, Annotated Code of Maryland." Therefore, the boundarybetween the tidal and non-tidal waters of the state is the tidal wetlandsboundary.
PERSON

SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA)
The land in the floodplain subject to a one-percent or greaterchance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas aredesignated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood Insurance
Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30,and A99, and Zones VE and V1-30. The term includes areas shown onother flood maps that are identified in § BR 2-301(e).
START OF CONSTRUCTION
The date the building permit was issued, provided that theactual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,addition placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eightydays of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placementof permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouringof slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction ofcolumns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placementof a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction doesnot include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling,the installation of streets and/or walkways, the excavation for abasement, footings, piers, or foundations, or the erection of temporaryforms, or the installation on the property of accessory structures,such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not partof the main structure. For substantial improvements, the actual startof construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alterationaffects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE
That which is built or constructed; specifically, a walledand roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that isprincipally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE
Damage of any origin sustained by a building or structurewhereby the cost of restoring the building or structure to its before-damagedcondition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market valueof the building or structure before the damage occurred. Also usedas "substantially damaged" structure.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvementof a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fiftypercent of the market value of the building or structure before thestart of construction of the improvement. The term includes structureswhich have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repairwork performed. The term does not, however, include either:
(1)
Any project for improvement of a building or structure to correctexisting violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety codespecifications which have been identified by the local code enforcementofficial prior to submission of an application for a permit and whichare the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
(2)
Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alterationwill not preclude the structure's continued designation as anhistoric structure.
TEMPORARY STRUCTURE

VARIANCE
A grant of relief from the strict application of one or morerequirements of these regulations.
VIOLATION
Any construction or development in a special flood hazardarea that is being performed without an issued permit. The failureof a building, structure, or other development for which a permitis issued to be fully compliant with these regulations and the conditionsof the issued permit. A building, structure, or other developmentwithout the required design certification, the elevation certificate,or other evidence of compliance required is presumed to be a violationuntil such time as the required documentation is provided.
WATERCOURSE
The channel, including channel banks and bed, of non-tidalwaters of the state.

Uponconsideration of the purposes of these regulations, the individualcircumstances, and the considerations and limitations of this section,the County Commissioners may attach such conditions to variances asthey deem necessary to further the purpose of these regulations. The
County Commissioners shall notify, in writing, any applicant to whoma variance is granted to construct or substantially improve a buildingor structure with its lowest floor below the elevation required bythese regulations that the variance is to the floodplain managementrequirements of these regulations only and that the cost of federalflood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk, withrates up to twenty-five dollars per one hundred dollars of insurancecoverage. A record of all variance actions, including justificationfor issuance, shall be maintained pursuant to § BR 2-303(b)(11).
(b) Application for a variance.

The owner of property, or the owner's authorized agent,for which a variance is sought shall submit an application for a varianceto the Floodplain Administrator.
(2)
At a minimum, the application shall contain the following information:
name, address, and telephone number of the applicant and propertyowner; legal description of the property; parcel map; descriptionof the existing use; description of the proposed use; site map showingthe location of flood hazard areas, designated floodway boundaries,flood zones, base flood elevations, and flood protection setbacks;
description of the variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
Variance applications shall specifically address each of the considerationsin § BR 2-307(c).
(3)
If the application is for a variance to allow the lowest floor
(A Zones) or bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member (V
Zones and Coastal A Zones) of a building or structure below the applicableminimum elevation required by these regulations, the application shallinclude a statement signed by the owner that, if granted, the conditionsof the variance shall be recorded on the deed of the property.
(c) Considerations for variances. The Floodplain
Administrator shall request comments on variance applications fromthe Maryland Department of the Environment (National Flood Insurance
Program State Coordinator) and shall provide such comments to the
County Commissioners. In considering variance applications, the County
Commissioners shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations,all relevant factors, requirements specified in other sections ofthese regulations, and the following factors:
(1)
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to theinjury of others.
(2)
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
(3)
The susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents
(if applicable) to flood damage and the effect of such damage on theindividual owner.
(4)
The importance of the services to the community provided bythe proposed development.
(5)
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed usewhich are not subject to, or are subject to less, flooding or erosiondamage.
(6)
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, whereapplicable, or if the facility is a functionally dependent use.
(7)
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipateddevelopment.
(8)
The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Planand Hazard Mitigation Plan for that area.
(9)
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for passengervehicles and emergency vehicles.
(10)

Good and sufficientcause deals solely with the physical characteristics of the propertyand cannot be based on the character of the improvement, the personalcharacteristics of the owner/inhabitants, or local provision thatregulates standards other than health and public safety.
(2)
A determination that failure to grant the variance would resultin exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of theproperty. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirementsof these regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship tothe applicant.
(3)
A determination that the granting of a variance for developmentwithin any designated floodway, or flood hazard area with base floodelevations but no designated floodway, will not result in increasedflood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations.
(4)
A determination that the granting of a variance will not resultin additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense,nuisances, fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict withexisting laws.
(5)
A determination that the building, structure or other developmentis protected by methods that minimize flood damages.
(6)
A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary toafford relief, considering the flood hazard.

§ ZS 1-307      Single-family clustered housing.

[[CONTENT]]
(a) Purpose and intent. Clusteringof single-family dwelling units is encouraged in order to providefor and maintain large open space areas which may in turn providefor the recreational needs of the residents, as well as bufferingof sensitive natural habitats, and the protection and improvementof water quality. In addition, clustering provides a more efficientuse of land and may require less area to be used for the constructionof roads, utilities and other public facilities. Cluster subdivisionsare permitted in the E, V and R Districts, subject to Planning Commissionapproval.
(b) General design standards. In order to provide for more efficient use of land, protection ofthe environment, more livable communities, and consistency with the
Comprehensive Plan, the following design standards shall apply:
(1) All development plans shall first identify keyenvironmental features and then design the development plan in sucha manner as to protect and avoid disturbance of these resources. Specialconsideration shall be given to wetlands, forested areas, existingsignificant trees, floodplains, source water and aquifer rechargeprotection areas, areas of critical habitat, water bodies on the state'simpaired waters list or having an established total maximum dailyload requirement and other important environmental features. Wherepossible, those areas contained in the one-hundred-year floodplainshould be dedicated as open space or recreational areas.
(2) Cluster residential land uses to minimize the consumptionof vacant land, maximize open space and reduce impervious surfaces.
(3) Limit the use of culs-de-sac and dead-end streetsand instead promote street, trail and sidewalk connectivity to reducevehicle miles traveled and improve community walkability.
(4) Preserve existing forested areas and natural areasas greenways within and around developments for environmental andrecreational purposes and to blend the man-made and natural environments.
(c) Specific standards. Thefollowing specific standards shall apply to single-family clusteredhousing:
(1) The minimum land area for a cluster subdivisionshall be four contiguous acres.
(2) The maximum density permitted for a clustered housingsubdivision shall be one and thirty-five hundredths times the densityallowed for a conventional single-family subdivision in that zoningdistrict. Major fractions of units shall be counted as a full unit.
(3) The project as a whole shall provide a minimumroad frontage of thirty-five feet, lot width of one hundred feet,front yard setback of thirty-five feet and all other yard setbacksof twenty feet.
(4) Individual lots within the subdivision shall complywith the lot area, lot width and setback requirements listed for single-familyclustered housing within that zoning district.
(5) All interior roads and parking areas and all accesspoints to the public road system shall be designed and constructedto County road standards.
(6) Notwithstanding the provisions of § ZS 1-315(d)(1)B,any single-family clustered housing development containing a totalof twenty or fewer dwelling units shall provide a minimum of fiftypercent of the land area to be retained in permanent open space inaccordance with the following provisions:
A. Further subdivision of open space or its use forother than active or passive noncommercial recreation, conservationor agriculture (except for easements for underground utilities) shallbe prohibited. This restriction shall be included on the record plator approved site plan as well as recorded in an open space easement.
Structures and buildings accessory to active or passive noncommercialrecreation, conservation or agriculture may be erected on open space,subject to the provisions of § ZS 1-325 hereof.
B. A maximum of fifty percent of the required openspace may be comprised of wetlands.
C. Active and passive recreation areas are to be easilyaccessible to all residents of the development.
D. Open space used for other than conservation shallbe appropriately maintained. The developer shall provide copies ofdeeds, deed covenants or conservation easements to the Planning Commissiondescribing land management practices and responsibilities (includingcollection of fees where appropriate) to be followed by whicheverparty or parties are responsible for maintenance. Where required bythe Planning Commission, a homeowners' association shall be establishedfor the purpose of permanently maintaining all open space and recreationalfacilities. Such homeowners' association agreements, guaranteeingcontinuing maintenance, shall be submitted to the County prior tothe issuance of any building permits and are subject to the approvalof the County Attorney for legal sufficiency. Copies of recorded documentsshall be provided by the developer to the Department upon recording.
The covenants shall contain a provision for maintenance of such openspace by the County Commissioners at their option where a responsibleparty fails to properly maintain such open space. Any funds expendedfor such maintenance by the County Commissioners shall be assessedpro rata against benefited lot or dwelling unit owners and shall bea lien and collectable in the same manner as real estate taxes.
E. Any single-family clustered housing developmentcontaining greater than twenty dwelling units shall provide open spacein accordance with the provisions of § ZS 1-315(d)(2)B
hereof.
F. The Planning Commission may grant waivers to thissubsection where it determines that conditions exist such that thefull provisions for open space as required by this subsection areotherwise satisfied. The Planning Commission shall consider proximityto public open spaces, lot size and other appropriate factors.
(d) Planning Commission review. In order to receive approval for a cluster subdivision, the applicantmust first submit a sketch plan as provided for in Title 2, Subdivision
Regulations. The Planning Commission shall review the sketch planfor compliance with the provisions and intent of this Title and theprovisions of Title 2, Subdivision Regulations. In reviewing the sketchplan, the Planning Commission may recommend such additional conditionsor modifications to the project as it deems necessary to ensure fullcompliance with the provisions and intent of this Title.

[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ ZS 1-308      Rural cluster subdivisions.

[[CONTENT]]
(a) Purpose and intent. Ruralcluster subdivisions are encouraged in order to preserve agriculturallands by grouping residential uses more closely together. This willreduce fragmentation and inefficient utilization of farmland, preventstripping of lots along roadways, and preserve the open vistas andrural character of the landscape. To promote use of this subdivisiontechnique, an additional lot for residential purposes beyond thatpermitted as a minor subdivision will be allowed subject to the standardsand requirements contained herein. Rural cluster subdivisions arepermitted in the A and E Districts.
(b) Standards. The followingstandards shall apply to rural cluster subdivisions:
(1) All development plans shall first identify keyenvironmental features and then design the development plan in sucha manner as to protect and avoid disturbance of these resources. Specialconsideration shall be given to wetlands, forested areas, existingsignificant trees, floodplains, source water and aquifer rechargeprotection areas, areas of critical habitat, water bodies on the state'simpaired waters list or having an established total maximum dailyload requirement and other important environmental features. Thoseareas contained in the one-hundred-year floodplain should be avoided.
They may be included in the lot area of an individual lot but notwithin its buildable area unless the entire property is located withinthe one-hundred-year floodplain.
(2) All rural cluster subdivisions shall be designedin a single compact arrangement where each lot other than the firstor last lot shares at least two lot lines in common with other lotsin the same cluster. The reference to "first or last lot" shall beconstrued to be the orientation of the lots rather than their orderof creation.
(3) Except as provided herein, no lot in a rural clustersubdivision may have a lot area less than forty thousand square feetor greater than ninety thousand square feet.
(4) Where the Environmental Programs Division permitsseptic disposal areas to be located remote from the lot, the minimumlot requirement may be reduced to twenty thousand square feet.
(5) No boundary line of any residential lot in a ruralcluster subdivision shall be located closer than two hundred feetto any public or approved private road.
(6) For the purposes of this section the lots shallbe connected to a public road or approved private road by a right-of-wayor access easement of not less than twenty feet in width. Any right-of-wayor easement created to provide access, drainage and installation ofutilities to serve such lots shall be constructed and stabilized insuch a manner as to provide for safe access for emergency vehiclesand shall be sufficient to serve all of the lots for as long as thesubdivision exists or the access is replaced by other means. The lotowners served by such a right-of-way or easement shall execute appropriateagreements to provide for the continued maintenance of the right-of-wayor access easement by the lot owners. These executed agreements shallbe approved by the Department and recorded among the land recordsof Worcester County prior to or simultaneously with the recordationof the subdivision plat.
(7) All rural cluster subdivisions shall be reviewedand approved in accordance with the plat procedures for minor subdivisionsas contained in Subtitle ZS2:III, §§ ZS2-301 through
2-304.
(8) The provisions of this section shall not applyto parcels of land where three or more lots which do not comply withthe provisions of this section have previously been subdivided andrecorded among the land records of Worcester County from what wasa single parcel of land as it existed on July 25, 1967.

§ ZS 1-309      Consolidated development rights subdivisions.

[[CONTENT]]
(a) Purpose and intent. Consolidateddevelopment rights subdivisions are intended to allow landowners,particularly farmers, to share in the economic benefits of developmentwhile more importantly preserving one of Worcester County's most traditionaland important ways of life, farming. This technique will enable subdivisionrights to be transferred to sites where the development would be mostappropriate from the viewpoints of both wastewater disposal and neighborhoodcompatibility. It will reduce fragmentation and inefficient utilizationof farmland, prevent stripping of lots along roadways, and preservethe open vistas and rural character of the landscape. The intent isto allow for some consolidation of development rights otherwise permittedon separate parcels. It is not the intent to facilitate sprawl vialarge subdivisions in rural areas and thus create conflicts betweenland uses and inefficient use of resources.
(b) General design standards. In order to provide for more efficient use of land, protection ofthe environment, more livable communities, and consistency with the
Comprehensive Plan, the following design standards shall apply:
(1) All development plans shall first identify keyenvironmental features and then design the development plan in sucha manner as to protect and avoid disturbance of these resources. Specialconsideration shall be given to wetlands, forested areas, existingsignificant trees, floodplains, source water and aquifer rechargeprotection areas, areas of critical habitat, water bodies on the state'simpaired waters list or having an established total maximum dailyload requirement and other important environmental features. Wherepossible, those areas contained in the one-hundred-year floodplainshould be dedicated as open space or recreational areas.
(2) Cluster residential land uses to minimize the consumptionof vacant land, maximize open space and reduce impervious surfaces.
(3) Limit the use of culs-de-sac and dead end streetsand instead promote street, trail and sidewalk connectivity to reducevehicle miles traveled and improve community walkability.
(4) Preserve existing forested areas and natural areasas greenways within and around developments for environmental andrecreational purposes and to blend the man-made and natural environments.
(c) Specific standards. Thefollowing standards shall apply to consolidated development rightssubdivisions:
(1) Subdivision development rights may be transferredbetween contiguous parcels in the A-2 and E-1 Districts which areunder the same ownership as of the effective date of this section.
(2) Subject to the limitations cited in Subsection
(c)(2)A hereof, the density permitted in the E-1 District shall bethe maximum permitted by the district regulations and the densitypermitted in the A-2 District shall be equal to the sum total of thegross number of divisions remaining for each parcel as determinedby the definition of "subdivision, minor" as contained in § ZS 1-311
hereof, with the maximum density in the A-2 District not to exceedtwenty lots.
A. The subdivision development rights from the transferringparcel used to calculate the gross number of divisions shall meetthe definition of a "lot" as defined in §§ ZS 1-103
and ZS 2-104, have not less than two thousand five hundred squarefeet of buildable lot area and shall be reasonably capable of supportinga conventional septic disposal system based upon review of the mappedsoils by the Department. Any decision of the Department in this regardshall be final.
(3) The applicant shall record among the land recordsof Worcester County an instrument acceptable to the County Attorneywhich shall perpetually extinguish the right to any future subdivisionor development of the transferring properties other than those nonresidentialuses or structures which meet the definition of "agriculture" as containedin § ZS 1-103 hereof.
(4) All subdivisions created under the terms of thissection shall be designed in a single compact arrangement where eachlot other than the first or last lot shares at least two lot linesin common with other lots in the subdivision. The reference to "firstor last lot" shall be construed to be the orientation of the lotsrather than their order of creation.
(5) Except as provided herein, no lot created as partof a consolidated development rights subdivision may have a lot arealess than forty thousand square feet or greater than ninety thousandsquare feet. Notwithstanding the provisions of § ZS 1-116(c)(4)
hereof, the maximum lot area of ninety thousand square feet cannotbe increased by action of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(6) Where the Environmental Programs Division permitsseptic disposal areas to be located remote from the lot, the minimumlot requirement may be reduced to twenty thousand square feet.
(7) No boundary line of any residential lot createdas part of a consolidated development rights subdivision shall belocated closer than two hundred feet to any public or approved privateroad.
(8) Where a consolidated development rights subdivisioncontains six or fewer lots, it shall be connected to a public roador approved private road by a right-of-way or access easement of notless than twenty feet in width. Where a consolidated development rightssubdivision contains more than six lots, it shall be connected toa public road or approved private road by a right-of-way, access easementor approved private road of not less than twenty-four feet in width.
Any right-of-way, easement or approved private road created to provideaccess, drainage and installation of utilities to serve such lotsshall be constructed and stabilized in such a manner as to providefor safe access for emergency vehicles and shall be sufficient toserve all of the lots for as long as the subdivision exists or theaccess is replaced by other means. The lot owners served by such aright-of-way, easement or approved private road shall execute appropriateagreements to provide for the continued maintenance of the right-of-way,access easement or approved private road by the lot owners. Theseexecuted agreements shall be approved by the Department and recordedamong the land records of Worcester County prior to or simultaneouslywith the recordation of the subdivision plat.

Subtitle NR3:I	    	Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area

[[START-PAGE]]

[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ NR 3-101      Intent; purpose; findings; severability.

[[CONTENT]]
(a)
Intent. In 2002 the Maryland General
Assembly passed the Atlantic Coastal Bays Protection Act for the purposeof preserving, protecting, and improving the water quality and naturalhabitats of the Atlantic Coastal Bays and their tributaries. The Legislaturehas determined that the Atlantic Coastal Bays require especially sensitiveconsideration with regard to development. It is the intent of the
County Commissioners to establish a local program to implement therequirements of the Act.
(b)
Purpose. It is the purpose of the County
Commissioners in enacting this Subtitle:
(1) To establish a Resource Protection Program forthe Atlantic coastal bays and their tributaries by fostering moresensitive development activity for certain shoreline areas so as tominimize damage to water quality and natural habitats;
(2) To implement the Resource Protection Program; and
(3) To authorize, ordain and impose a critical areaprotection program to provide for reasonable restrictions, reasonablyenforced on properties in the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area.
(c)
Findings. The County Commissioners findand declare that:
(1) The Atlantic coastal bays and their tributariesare natural resources of great significance to the County;
(2) The shoreline and adjacent lands constitute a valuable,fragile, and sensitive part of this estuarine system, where humanactivity can have a particularly immediate and adverse impact on waterquality and natural habitats;
(3) The capacity of these shoreline and adjacent landsto withstand continuing demands without further degradation to waterquality and natural habitats is limited;
(4) Studies have documented that the quality and productivityof the waters of the Atlantic coastal bays and their tributaries havedeclined due to the cumulative effects of human activity that havecaused increased levels of pollutants, nutrients, and toxins in thebay systems and declines in more protective land uses such as forestlandand agricultural land in the watershed.
(5) Those portions of the Atlantic coastal bays andtheir tributaries within Maryland are particularly stressed by thecontinuing population growth and development activity concentratedin the Ocean City, West Ocean City, Ocean Pines, St. Martins Neck,
South Point, and Maryland Route 611 Corridor areas;
(6) The quality of life for the citizens of Worcester
County would be enhanced through the restoration of the quality andproductivity of the waters of the Atlantic coastal bays and theirtributaries;
(7) The preservation of the Atlantic coastal bays andtheir tributaries is dependent, in part, on minimizing further adverseimpacts to the water quality and natural habitats of the shorelineand adjacent lands;
(8) The cumulative impact of current development practicesis inimical to these purposes;
(9) It is in the County's interest for the benefitof current and future generations to foster more sensitive developmentactivity in a consistent and uniform manner along shoreline areasof the Atlantic coastal bays and their tributaries so as to minimizedamage to water quality and natural habitats; and
(10) It is the public policy of the County Commissionersof Worcester County that, where possible, a setback of one hundredfeet from the mean high water line of tidal waters, the edge of thebank of tributary streams, and the landward extent of tidal wetlandsbe provided on all lots and for all structures and other improvementscreated or erected after the effective date of this Subtitle. To thatend it is hereby declared that any private restriction or covenantheretofore or hereinafter enacted which has the effect of precluding,impeding or encumbering the ability of the owner of a lot to maximizea yard setback on the waterfront and/or wetlands side of a lot inorder to achieve the setback of one hundred feet or as much thereofthat may be reasonable is hereby declared void as against public policy,provided zoning minimums are met.
(11) Because of the limited distance between the headwatersof the watershed of the Atlantic coastal bays and the bays themselves,upstream activities have a direct impact on the quality and functionof the water bodies of the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area. Therefore,additional protections of certain areas beyond the limits of the Atlantic
Coastal Bays Critical Area are necessary.
(12) Existing state regulations do not require mitigationfor impacts to non-tidal wetlands and their associated buffers underall circumstances. Therefore, the County Commissioners find it advisableto provide for additional protection for impacts to non-tidal wetlandsand their buffers beyond the limits of the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical
Area but within the watershed of that Critical Area.
(d)
Goals. The goals of the Atlantic Coastal
Bays Critical Area Law are to accomplish the following:
(1) Minimize adverse impacts on water quality thatresult from pollutants that are discharged from structures or runofffrom surrounding lands;
(2) Conserve fish, wildlife, and plant habitat; and
(3) Establish land use policies for development inthe Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area which accommodate growth aswell as address the environmental impacts that the number, movement,and activities of people may have on the area.
(e)
Citing. This Subtitle may be cited asthe "Worcester County Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Law."
(f)
Territory affected. Within Worcester
County, the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area shall mean all landsand waters defined in § 8-1807 of the Natural Resources

§ NR 3-103      Development in the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area.

[[CONTENT]]
(a)
Generally. In order to accommodate alreadyexisting land uses and growth in the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical
Area while providing for the conservation of habitat and the protectionof water quality, the County Program has set out three land classificationareas within the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area, which are asfollows: the Intensely Developed Areas (IDAs), the Limited Development
Areas (LDAs), and the Resource Conservation Areas (RCAs).
(1) While any intense development should be directedoutside of the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area, future intensedevelopment activities, when proposed in the Atlantic Coastal Bays
Critical Area, shall be directed towards the Intensely Developed Areas.
(2) Additional low intensity development may be permittedin the Limited Development Areas but shall be subject to strict regulationto prevent adverse impacts on habitat and water quality.
(3) Development shall be limited in the Resource Conservation
Area, which shall be chiefly designated for agriculture, forestry,fisheries activities, other resource utilization activities and forhabitat protection.
(b)
Implementation. For the purposes of implementingthese regulations the County Commissioners have determined, basedon land uses and development in existence on June 1, 2002, which landareas fall within the three types of land classification areas inaccordance with COMAR Title 27, as from time to time amended, andas described in this Program. These three types of land classificationareas are designated on maps on file in the Department or its successor.
(c)
Application and interpretation of land classification area boundaries.
(1) Where uncertainty exists about the boundaries ofland classification areas as shown on the official Atlantic Coastal
Bays Critical Area maps due to errors in map and/or overlay registration,the following rules shall apply:
A. Where a known upland lot or parcel is shown as beingtidally influenced, the land classification area of the closest uplandlot or parcel shall apply.
B. Where a land classification area district boundaryas shown on the maps does not exactly coincide with the actual propertyline in existence as of the date of adoption of this Subtitle it shallbe deemed to coincide with the property line.
(2) For development activities on properties bisectedby the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area line which have at leastfifty percent of their land area contained within the Atlantic Coastal
Bays Critical Area, the entire property may be developed in accordancewith this Subtitle if the owner so chooses and, if so, the requirementsof Subtitle 4 (Forest Conservation) of the Natural Resources Articleof the Code of Public Local Laws of Worcester County, Maryland shallnot apply.
(d)
Activities not permitted except in Intensely Developed
Areas. Certain new development, redevelopment or expandedactivities or facilities, because of their intrinsic nature or becauseof their potential for adversely affecting habitats or water quality,may not be permitted in the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area exceptin Intensely Developed Areas under regulations of this section andonly after the activity or facility has demonstrated to all appropriatelocal and state permitting agencies that there will be a net improvementin water quality to the adjacent body of water. These activities includethe following:
(1) Non-maritime heavy industry;
(2) Transportation facilities and utility transmissionfacilities, except those necessary to serve permitted uses, or whereregional or interstate facilities must cross tidal waters (utilitytransmission facilities do not include power plants); or
(3) Permanent sludge handling, storage and disposalfacilities, other than those associated with wastewater treatmentfacilities. However, agricultural or horticultural use of sludge underappropriate approvals when applied by an approved method at approvedapplication rates may be permitted in the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical
Area, except in the one-hundred-foot buffer;
(e)
Activities not permitted. Certain newdevelopment activities or facilities, or the expansion of certainexisting facilities, because of their intrinsic nature or becauseof their potential for adversely affecting habitat and water quality,may not be permitted in the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area unlessno environmentally acceptable alternative exists outside of the Atlantic
Coastal Bays Critical Area, and these development activities or facilitiesare needed in order to correct an existing water quality or wastewatermanagement problem. These include:[Amended 10-24-2006 by Bill No. 06-11]
(1) Solid or hazardous waste collection or disposalfacilities, including transfer stations;
(2) Sanitary landfills; or

(3) For residential development, where possible a communitypier shall be provided rather than individual piers.
(e)
Deduction methodology. The followingstandards shall be used to determine the area of growth allocationto be deducted when the designation of a parcel or a portion of aparcel is changed through the growth allocation process:
(1) Subdivision of any lot of record existing as of
June 1, 2002, and which is classified as Resource Conservation Areaor Limited Development Area, where all or part of the parcel is identifiedby the County Commissioners as a growth allocation area, shall resultin the acreage of the entire parcel, excluding tidal wetlands, beingdeducted from the jurisdiction's growth allocation, unless the developmentenvelope concept outlined in Subsection (e)(2) below is used.
(2) In order to allow some flexibility in the use ofgrowth allocation when development is only proposed on a portion ofthe property, the following methodology may be used for parcels designatedas Resource Conservation Area. On a parcel proposed for the use ofgrowth allocation, a single development envelope may be specifiedand the acreage of the development envelope rather than the acreageof the entire parcel shall be deducted from the County's growth allocationif the development envelope meets the following criteria:
A. The development envelope shall include individuallyowned lots, required buffers, impervious surfaces, roads, utilities,stormwater management measures, on-site sewage disposal measures,any areas subject to human use such as active recreation areas, andany additional acreage needed to meet the development requirementsof the criteria. The required buffers refer to the minimum one-hundred-footbuffer and the twenty-five-foot non-tidal wetlands buffer.
B. Only one development envelope shall be establishedper parcel of land.
C. If a development envelope is proposed in the Resource
Conservation Area, a minimum of twenty acres must remain outside ofthe development envelope or the acreage of the entire parcel mustbe deducted. If the original parcel in the Resource Conservation Areais less than twenty acres, then the acreage of the entire parcel mustbe deducted. If there is a permanently protected Resource Conservation
Area (an area protected by recorded easement) adjacent and contiguousto an undeveloped remainder which totals less than twenty acres andwhich together will result in a minimum twenty-acre undeveloped area,then only that portion of the parcel which is to be developed hasto be deducted.
D. The minimum twenty-acre undeveloped remainder outsideof the development envelope may be developed at an Resource Conservation
Area density unless some type of permanent protection exists thatrestricts development.
(3) For growth allocation proposed in the Resource
Conservation Area, a three-hundred-foot naturally vegetated bufferis strongly encouraged and where it is provided, it shall not be deductedeven if the buffer does not meet the twenty-acre requirement.

§ NR 3-126      Shore erosion protection works.

[[CONTENT]]
(a)
Generally. As an alternative to structuralerosion controls which can disturb the aquatic environment and increaseerosion downstream, the County Commissioners encourage the use ofnon-structural controls such as marsh creation, maintenance of bufferzones, and the establishment of natural barriers to prevent intrusionon fragile vegetated shorelines. The criteria set forth in this chapterare not intended to apply to those structures necessarily associatedwith water-dependent facilities as discussed in § NR 3-124
of this Subtitle.
(b)
General requirements. In protecting shoreareas from erosion the Department shall follow these requirements:
(1) Encourage the protection of rapidly eroding portionsof the shoreline in the Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area by publicand private landowners;
(2) Where such measures can effectively and practicallyreduce or prevent shore erosion, encourage the use of non-structuralshore protection measures in order to conserve and protect plant,fish and wildlife habitat.
(c)
Implementation. Each application forshore erosion protection shall demonstrate how it complies with thefollowing objectives:
(1) Structural control measures shall only be usedin areas with significantly eroding shorelines and where non-structuralmeasures would not be practical or effective in controlling erosion.
(2) Where structural erosion control is required, themeasure that best provides for conservation of fish and plant habitatand which is practical and effective shall be used;
(3) Non-structural measures shall be utilized in areasof erosion where they would be a practical and effective method oferosion control;
(4) Structural erosion measures shall not be encouragedin areas where no significant erosion occurs;
(5) If significant alterations in the characteristicsof a shoreline occur, the measure that best fits the change may beused for sites in that area.
(6) Vegetation removed in the buffer for constructionof shore erosion control measures shall be replaced at an equal basis.
(d)
Process. The Department, in reviewingany application for a permit for structural erosion control devices,may refer the application to the soil Conservation District, the Departmentof Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment for fieldverification of the need for the structural erosion control as wellas for recommendations on proposed erosion control mechanisms.
(1) Any application made to the Department for theinstallation of an erosion control device must, at a minimum, includethe following information:
A. Photograph of erosion problem;
B. The specific location of the site on a USGS 7.5
topographic map;
C. Soil type and erodibility;
D. Proposed and existing land use.
(2) Applications must include appropriate authorizationfrom the Maryland Department of the Environment and the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers.

§ NR 3-127      Non-tidal wetland and non-tidal wetland buffer regulations.

[[CONTENT]]
(a)
Generally. For development activitieslocated on lots and parcels created after June 1, 2002, within the
Atlantic coastal bays watershed lying outside the Atlantic Coastal
Bays Critical Area where the state permits non-tidal wetland bufferimpacts without mitigation, mitigation as provided for below is requiredby this subsection. For activities in these areas that the state classifiesas "temporary impacts", mitigation is not required.
(b)
Site plan requirements. For any projectthat impacts the non-tidal wetland or its buffer, the following mustbe shown in addition to the other site plan requirements of this Subtitleon any site plan submitted to the Department:
(1) The boundary of any non-tidal wetlands and anynon-tidal wetlands buffers.
(2) The limits of disturbance within the non-tidalwetlands and non-tidal wetlands buffer.
(3) The location and boundaries of any on-site mitigationproject proposed or required by this subsection.
(4) The location and boundaries of any off-site mitigationproject proposed or required by this subsection.
(c)
Required mitigation. For regulated activitiesthat impact the non-tidal wetland and non-tidal wetland buffer, mitigationwill be required at an equal basis on-site and at an areal extenttwice that off-site. Natural vegetation similar to the vegetationdestroyed by the impact shall be used, either through regenerationof the disturbed area or through planting. Mitigation of non-tidalwetland and non-tidal wetland buffer impacts shall not be allowedto count toward a project's afforestation and/or reforestation requirements.
(d)
Priority sequence for mitigation site selection. All mitigation sites proposed for compliance with this subsectionshall be accomplished in accordance with the following preferred locationalsequence:
(1) On-site adjacent to a non-tidal wetland or itsbuffer.
(2) On-site between and connecting existing forestedareas.
(3) On-site where establishing or enhancing forestbuffers adjacent to critical habitats where appropriate.
(4) On-site within the one-hundred-year floodplain.
(5) Off-site mitigation will only be allowed if itis demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Department that on-sitemitigation is not practicable. Offsite mitigation shall be on a two-to-oneratio and shall take place in accordance with the locational sequencespecified in Subsection (d)(1) through (4) above.
(e)
Planting methodology. If the mitigationproject requires planting, the planting shall take place in accordancewith the provisions of the current Forest Conservation Manual withrespect to planting techniques and specifications. Planting associatedwith required mitigation shall be performed prior to the issuanceof any zoning certificate or certificate of use and occupancy or shallbe bonded in accordance with the provisions of § ZS 1-124
of the Worcester County Zoning Ordinance. Natural regeneration maybe permitted in lieu of planting where:
(1) Seventy-five percent of the proposed mitigationarea is located within 50 feet of adjoining forest or the proposedplanting area is a forest opening less than one acre in size; and
(2) Adjoining forest has a maximum of twenty-percentcover of invasive exotic species.
(f)
Perpetual protective agreements. Anyperson required to mitigate impacts to a non-tidal wetland or non-tidalwetland buffer in accordance with the provisions of this subsectionshall enter into a perpetual protective agreement as prescribed by
§ NR 1-415(g) and (h) hereof to ensure that the vegetationused for mitigation shall be protected against clearing and the detrimentaleffects of invasive species.

Subtitle NR3:II	    	Chesapeake Bay Critical Area

[[START-PAGE]]

[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ NR 3-201      Purpose; intent; severability.

[[CONTENT]]
(a)
Intent. In 1984, the Maryland General
Assembly passed the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Act[1] in response to growing concern over the decline of thequality and productivity of the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and itstributaries. The decline was found to have resulted, in part, fromthe cumulative effects of human activity that caused increased levelsof pollutants, nutrients, and toxins, and also from declines in protectiveland uses such as forest land and agricultural land in the Bay region.
[1]
Editor's Note: See Natural Resources Article of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, § 8-1801 et seq.
(b)
Purpose. The General Assembly enactedthe Critical Area Act for the following purposes:
(1)
To establish a resource protection program for the Chesapeake
Bay and its tributaries by fostering more sensitive development activityfor certain shoreline areas so as to minimize impacts to water qualityand natural habitats; and
(2)
To implement a resource protection program on a cooperativebasis between the state and affected local governments, with localgovernments establishing and implementing their programs in a consistentand uniform manner subject to state criteria and oversight.
(c)
Goals. The goals of the Critical Area
Program are to accomplish the following:
(1)
Minimize adverse impacts on water quality that result from pollutantsthat are discharged from structures or run off from surrounding lands;
(2)
Conserve fish, wildlife, and plant habitat; and
(3)
Establish land use policies for development in the Chesapeake
Bay Critical Area which accommodate growth as well as address theenvironmental impacts that the number, movement, and activities ofpeople may have on the area.
(d)
Citing. This Subtitle may be cited asthe "Worcester County Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Ordinance."
(e)
Implementation. Worcester County adoptedits Critical Area Program on May 30, 1990. The Program consists ofthis Subtitle, the County's Critical Area maps, the County's
Zoning and Subdivision Control Article, and any other portion of the
Code of Public Local Laws of Worcester County, Maryland, found tobe applicable. These provisions regulate development activities andresource utilization activities, e.g., agriculture and forestry, withinthe Critical Area. They supplement existing land use regulations byimposing specific standards and requirements as set forth in the Critical
Area Criteria. Compliance with this Subtitle does not imply compliancewith any other local, state or federal law and does not remove responsibilityfor compliance with such laws.
(f)
Territory affected. Within Worcester County, the Chesapeake
Bay Critical Area shall mean all lands and waters defined in § 8-1807
of the Natural Resources Article, Annotated Code of Maryland. Theyinclude:
(1)
All waters of and lands under the Chesapeake Bay and its tributariesto the head of tide as indicated on the state wetlands maps, and allstate and private wetlands designated under Title 9 of the Natural
Resources Article, Annotated Code of Maryland.
(2)
All land and water areas within one thousand feet beyond thelandward boundaries of state or private wetlands and the heads oftides designated under Title 9 of the Natural Resources Article, Annotated
Code of Maryland.
(g)

§ NR 3-203      Development in Critical Area.

[[CONTENT]]
(a)
Generally. In order to accommodate alreadyexisting land uses and growth in the Worcester County Critical Areawhile providing for the conservation of habitat and the protectionof water quality, the County has set out three land use managementdistricts within the Critical Area. The Critical Area has also beendefined as an Overlay Zoning District in the County Zoning Ordinance.
The County has identified each of the three subdistricts within the
Critical Area based on the following criteria and has developed policiesand programs to achieve the objectives as proposed by the County Program.
The County recognizes the following three types of development areas:
Intensely Developed Areas (IDAs);
Limited Development Areas (LDAs); and
Resource Conservation Areas (RCAs).
(1)
While any intense development should be directed outside ofthe Critical Area, future intense development activities, when proposedin the Critical Area, shall be directed towards the Intensely Developed
Areas.
(2)
Additional low-intensity development may be permitted in the
Limited Development areas, but shall be subject to strict regulationto prevent adverse impacts on habitat and water quality.
(3)
Development shall be limited in the Resource Conservation Area,which shall be chiefly designated for agriculture, forestry, fisheriesactivities, other resource utilization activities and for habitatprotection.
(b)
Implementation. For purposes of implementingthis regulation, the County has determined, based on land uses anddevelopment in existence on December 1, 1985, which land areas fallwithin the three types of land management and development areas describedin this program. These three types of land management and developmentareas are designated on sets of maps on file in the County Departmentof Development Review and Permitting or its successor. These mapsinclude Department of Natural Resources Wetland Maps dated 1972 ata scale of one inch equals two hundred feet and Resource Inventory
Maps dated 1989 at a scale of one inch equals six hundred feet andare the official Worcester County Critical Area Maps.
(c)
Activities not permitted except in IDA. Certain new development, redevelopment or expanded activities orfacilities, because of their intrinsic nature or because of theirpotential for adversely affecting habitats or water quality, may notbe permitted in the Critical Area except in Intensely Developed Areasunder regulations of this section and only after the activity or facilityhas demonstrated to all appropriate local and state permitting agenciesthat there will be a net improvement in water quality to the adjacentbody of water. These activities include the following:
(1)
Non-maritime heavy industry;
(2)
Transportation facilities and utility transmission facilities,except those necessary to serve permitted uses, or where regionalor interstate facilities must cross tidal waters (utility transmissionfacilities do not include power plants); or
(3)
Permanent sludge handling, storage and disposal facilities,other than those associated with wastewater treatment facilities.
However, agricultural or horticultural use of sludge under appropriateapprovals when applied by an approved method at approved applicationrates may be permitted in the Critical Area, except in the one-hundred-foot-buffer;
(4)
The County may preclude additional development activities thatit considers detrimental to water quality or fish, wildlife, or planthabitats within the Critical Area.
(d)
Activities not permitted. Certain newdevelopment activities or facilities, or the expansion of certainexisting facilities, because of their intrinsic nature or becauseof their potential for adversely affecting habitat and water quality,may not be permitted in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area unless noenvironmentally acceptable alternative exists outside of the Chesapeake
Bay Critical Area, and these development activities or facilitiesare needed in order to correct an existing water quality or wastewatermanagement problem. These include:[Amended 10-24-2006 by Bill No. 06-11]
(1)
Solid or hazardous waste collection or disposal facilities,including transfer stations;
(2)
Sanitary landfills; or
(3)
Sewage sludge composting, storage or disposal facilities orland application.

§ NR 3-207      Growth allocation.

[[CONTENT]]
(a)
Description. The upland area of the Countywithin the Critical Area comprises about nine thousand six hundredacres. Within the Critical Area, one hundred thirty acres of landwere classified as IDA or LDA. The remaining nine thousand four hundredseventy acres were classified as RCA. The State Critical Area Lawpermitted the County to allocate five percent of this area, or fourhundred seventy-three and five-tenths acres, for use for future growthas either IDA or LDA. Since the initial allocation, a growth allocationtotaling three acres granted to the town of Snow Hill and the correctionof a mapping mistake from RCA to IDA and totaling eighteen and eighty-ninehundredths acres along MD Rt. 12 immediately northeast of Snow Hillhas reduced this amount available for future growth allocation tofour hundred fifty-one and sixty-one hundredths acres. This acreageshall be used for the expansion of existing or the creation of new
LDAs and IDAs under the following general guidelines:
(1)
The total area of expansion of Intensely Developed or Limited
Development Areas, or both, shall not exceed four hundred seventy-threeand five-tenths acres.
(2)
When permitting future expansion of Intensely Developed and
Limited Development Areas near the municipalities of Snow Hill and
Pocomoke City, the County shall notify the appropriate local officialsto allow them an opportunity to comment on how the expansion may affectthese municipalities.
(b)
Requirements. When locating new Intensely
Developed or Limited Development Areas the County shall use theserequirements:
(1)
New Intensely Developed Areas should be located in Limited Development
Areas or adjacent to existing Intensely Developed Areas;
(2)
New Limited Development Areas should be located adjacent toexisting Limited Development Areas or Intensely Developed Areas;
(3)
New Intensely Developed Areas shall be at least twenty acresin size unless:
A.
They are contiguous to an existing IDA or LDA; or
B.
They are a grandfathered commercial or industrial use whichwas permitted and legally existing as of the date of local Programapproval. The amount of growth allocation deducted shall be equivalentto the area of the entire parcel or parcels subject to the growthallocation request.
(4)
No more than one-half of the allocated expansion may be locatedin Resource Conservation Areas except as provided in Subsection (b)(9)
below;
(5)
New Intensely Developed Areas and Limited Development Areasshould be located in order to minimize impacts to habitat protectionareas as specified in this Subtitle and in an area and in a mannerthat optimizes benefits to water quality;
(6)
New Intensely Developed Areas should be located where they minimizetheir impacts to the defined land uses of the Resource Conservation
Area;
(7)
New Intensely Developed Areas and Limited Development Areasin the Resource Conservation Area should be located at least threehundred feet landward of the limits of tidal wetlands or tidal waters;
(8)
New Intensely Developed or Limited Development Areas to be locatedin Resource Conservation Areas shall conform to all criteria of the
County for such areas, shall be so designated on the County Zoning
Map and shall constitute an amendment to this Program subject to reviewand approval by the County Planning Commission, the County Commissionersand the Critical Area Commission.
(9)
If the County is unable to utilize a portion of its growth allocationas set out in Subsection (b)(1) and (2) above within or adjacent toexisting Intensely Developed or Limited Development Areas, then thatportion of the allocated expansion which cannot be so located maybe located in the Resource Conservation Areas in addition to the expansionallowed in Subsection (b)(4) above. An applicant shall be requiredto cluster any development in an area of expansion authorized underthis Subsection (b)(9).
(c)
Process. Applicants for growth allocationshall submit a request for growth allocation accompanied by appropriateplans and environmental reports in accordance with the following process:
(1)
All applications for growth allocation shall be submitted tothe County Department of Development Review and Permitting. Requestsshall be accompanied by a concept plan and appropriate environmentalreports and studies so as to provide sufficient information to permitthe Planning Commission to review the application for consistencywith the County's Critical Area regulations. The subdivisionhistory of parcels designated as RCA must be provided as part of thegrowth allocation application. The date of December 1, 1985, is thedate used for the original Critical Area mapping and shall be usedas a beginning point of analysis.
(2)
All applications for growth allocation shall be forwarded tothe Planning Commission for review and shall include comments andrecommendations from the staff. The Planning Commission shall considerthe growth allocation request prior to making a recommendation onthe proposal to the County Commissioners.
(3)
The applicant shall address the Planning Commission's commentsand recommendations and may revise the concept plan accordingly. Thegrowth allocation request shall then be forwarded to the County Commissionersby the Planning Commission with a recommendation for either approvalor denial.
(4)
The County Commissioners shall hold a public hearing followingdue notice in accordance with § ZS 1-114 of the Zoning and
Subdivision Control Article on the request for growth allocation andany revisions to the concept plan.
(5)
The County Commissioners may establish conditions of approvalthat are consistent with the intent of the County's Critical
Area Program.
(6)
Upon approval of the growth allocation request by the County
Commissioners, the County shall send a request to the Critical Area
Commission to utilize a portion of their growth allocation. The requestshall be accompanied by pertinent plans and environmental reportsand studies. Upon receipt of the request from the County, the Critical
Area Commission shall notify the County regarding the processing ofthe request as an amendment or refinement to the County's Program.
Refinements shall be acted on within thirty days of the Commission'snotification to the County of a complete submission. Amendments willbe acted on within ninety days of the Commission's notificationof a complete submission.
(7)
Following approval of the growth allocation request by the Critical
Area Commission, the County Commissioners may implement the change,and the applicant may proceed to the preparation of the final siteplan or subdivision plat for recording in the County land records.
(8)
Prior to approving the final site plan or subdivision plat,the Planning Commission or its designee shall ensure that all conditionsof approval are incorporated into the final plan, public works agreement,deed covenants, etc.
(9)
Final subdivision plats and site plans shall be processed inaccordance with the requirements of this Subtitle and the County's
Subdivision Regulations.
(10)
The County's official Critical Area maps shall be amendedto reflect the new land classification and a copy of the new map shallbe provided to the Critical Area Commission.
(11)
As a condition of approval, the County may require that allprojects approved for the use of growth allocation shall demonstratethat they are substantially completed within three years of the dateof growth allocation approval by the Commission. Substantially completedshall be determined by the Planning Commission and is defined as projectsin which all public improvements such as roads, sewer and/or waterfacilities, etc. have been built and approved as required by the County.
(d)
Standards. Applicants for growth allocationshall demonstrate that the following design standards will be metor exceeded by the proposed project:
(1)
All requirements of the County's Critical Area Program,
Zoning Ordinance, and Subdivision Regulations have been met.
(2)
For residential development, the area to be developed shallbe limited to no more than fifty percent of the site.
(3)
In addition to meeting the minimum requirements of the Critical
Area regulations, the project design shall enhance the habitat valueor improve water quality in the area. For example, afforestation mayexceed the fifteen-percent requirement or best management practicesfor stormwater management may be installed on portions of the siteto remain in agricultural use.
(4)
For residential development, where possible a community piershall be provided rather than individual piers.
(e)
Deduction methodology. The followingstandards shall be used to determine the area of growth allocationto be deducted when the designation of a parcel or a portion of aparcel is changed through the growth allocation process:
(1)
Subdivision of any lot of record existing as of December 1,
1985, and which is classified as RCA or LDA, where all or part ofthe parcel is identified by the County as a growth allocation area,shall result in the acreage of the entire parcel, excluding tidalwetlands, being deducted from the jurisdiction's growth allocation,unless the development envelope concept outline in Subsection (e)(2)
below is used.
(2)
In order to allow some flexibility in the use of growth allocationwhen development is only proposed on a portion of the property, thefollowing methodology may be used for parcels designated as RCA. Ona parcel proposed for the use of growth allocation, a single developmentenvelope may be specified and the acreage of the development enveloperather than the acreage of the entire parcel shall be deducted fromthe County's growth allocation if the development envelope meetsthe following criteria:
A.
The development envelope shall include individually owned lots,required buffers, impervious surfaces, roads, utilities, stormwatermanagement measures, on-site sewage disposal measures, any areas subjectto human use such as active recreation areas, and any additional acreageneeded to meet the development requirements of the criteria. The requiredbuffers refer to the minimum one-hundred-foot buffer and the twenty-five-footnon-tidal wetlands buffer.
B.
Only one development envelope shall be established per parcelof land.
C.
If a development envelope is proposed in the RCA, a minimumof twenty acres must remain outside of the development envelope orthe acreage of the entire parcel must be deducted. If the originalparcel in the RCA is less than twenty acres, then the acreage of theentire parcel must be deducted. If there is a permanently protected
Resource Conservation Area (an area protected by recorded easement)
adjacent and contiguous to an undeveloped remainder which totals lessthan twenty acres and which together will result in a minimum twenty-acreundeveloped area, then only that portion of the parcel which is tobe developed has to be deducted.
D.
The minimum twenty-acre undeveloped remainder outside of thedevelopment envelope may be developed at an RCA density unless sometype of permanent protection exists that restricts development.
(3)
For growth allocation proposed in the RCA, a three-hundred-footnaturally vegetated buffer is strongly encouraged and where it isprovided, it shall not be deducted even if the buffer does not meetthe twenty-acre requirement.

June 1, 1984, if:
A.
At the time of development, the land is brought into conformancewith the Critical Area Program insofar as possible, including theconsolidation or configuration of lots not individually owned andthese procedures are approved by the Critical Areas Commission; or
B.
The land has received a building permit subsequent to December
1, 1985, but prior to local Program approval.

Individual trees may be removed which are in danger of fallingand causing damage to dwellings or other structures, or which arein danger of falling and therefore causing the blockage of streams,or resulting in accelerated shore erosion.
(4)
Horticultural practices may be used to maintain the health ofindividual trees.
(5)
Other cutting techniques may be undertaken within the bufferand under the advice and guidance of the State Departments of Agricultureand Natural Resources, if necessary to preserve the forest from extensivepest or disease infestation or threat from fire.
(e)
Buffer exemption areas. The County willconsider the designation and mapping of certain areas as buffer exemptionareas. The area requested for designation as a buffer exemption areamust be significant in size and characteristics to warrant the County'sapplication to the State Critical Area Commission for an amendmentto the County's Critical Area Program. Generally, it must besufficiently demonstrated that the existing pattern of developmentin the proposed buffer exemption area prevents the buffer from fulfillingthe functions set forth in § NR 3-219(b). If a buffer exemptionarea designation is requested, the County must propose other measuresfor achieving the water quality and habitat protection objectivesof the buffer policies. These measures may include, but are not necessarilylimited to offsets, public education and forestry programs. The measuresmust be approved under this Subtitle and by the Chesapeake Bay Critical
Area Commission.

Pocomoke Sand Ridge. This area is comprised of a system of ancientsand dunes and associated non-tidal wetlands which supports an endangeredspecies and several uncommon species, as more fully described in the
Worcester County Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Program.
(2)
Poorhouse Branch. This area encompasses riparian forest, wetlands,and the habitats of several threatened and endangered species, asmore fully described in the Worcester County Chesapeake Bay Critical
Area Program.
(3)
Bald eagle nests. There are several bald eagle nests along the
Pocomoke River, and special protection measures are necessary to keepthe region around these nests free from disturbance during the nestingseason. This significant habitat area is as more fully described inthe Worcester County Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Program.
(b)
General requirements. The County shallprovide for the protection of the known habitats of species in needof conservation and threatened and endangered species and also thehabitats of these species that may be identified in the future. Protectionmeasures for these habitat protection areas are to be developed inthe following way:
(1)
Local jurisdictions may defer development of protection measuresuntil such time as an activity is proposed within a protection area.
A.
Worcester County shall review the proposed activities on a case-by-casebasis and seek technical advice from the Department of Natural Resources.
Development of property located within the Critical Area of Worcester
County will require a site specific survey to be submitted along withdesign plans and a written description of the measures the propertyowner proposes to take to protect any habitats identified. This informationconcerning habitats will be incorporated into the County's Resource
Inventory Maps for future reference.
(c)
Standards for bald eagle protection. A
three-zone protection area of one-fourth mile (one thousand threehundred twenty feet) in radius around each bald eagle nest shall beestablished and within the zones the County shall comply with thefollowing recommended protection measures:
(1)
Zone 1 shall include the area extending from the nest out toa radius of three hundred thirty feet from the nest. In this zone,timber cutting, land clearing, and development activities are prohibited.
Hiking, fishing, and agricultural activities may be permitted from
June 16 to December 14. These activities and human activity in generalshall not be permitted in this zone from December 15 to June 15.
(2)
Zone 2 extends from the outer limit of Zone 1 to a radius ofsix hundred sixty feet from the nest. In this zone, major habitatchanges shall be avoided, including clear-cutting, land clearing,and development activity. Hunting, hiking, fishing, and agriculturalactivities may be permitted from June 16 to December 14. These activitiesand human activity in general shall not be permitted in this zonefrom December 15 to June 15. Agricultural activities may be permittedif Department of Natural Resources data indicate that the nestingeagles are tolerant of these activities. From August 16 to November
14, selective thinning and maintenance of timber stands and buildingand road maintenance may be permitted.
(3)
Zone 3 extends from the outer limit of Zone 2 to a radius ofone thousand three hundred twenty feet from the nest. Timber cutting,land clearing, and development activities shall be restricted from
December 15 to June 15. Other activities in this zone that are withinsight of the eagles on the nest may need to be restricted during thistime period in accordance with Department of Natural resources recommendations.
(4)
If a bald eagle nest has not been used for three successivenesting seasons, then any protective regulations applied to the specificsite may be removed after verification by the Department of Natural
Resources that the nest has been abandoned.

§ NR 3-225      Shore erosion protection works.

[[CONTENT]]
(a)
Generally. As an alternative to structuralerosion controls which can disturb the aquatic environment and increaseerosion downstream, the County encourages the use of non-structuralcontrols such as marsh creation, maintenance of buffer zones, andthe establishment of natural barriers to prevent intrusion on fragilevegetated shorelines. The criteria set forth in this Subtitle arenot intended to apply to those structures necessarily associated withwater-dependent facilities as discussed in § NR 3-224 ofthis Subtitle.
(b)
General requirements. In protecting shoreareas from erosion the County shall follow these requirements:
(1)
Encourage the protection of rapidly eroding portions of theshoreline in the Critical Area by public and private landowners;
(2)
Where such measures can effectively and practically reduce orprevent shore erosion, encourage the use of non-structural shore protectionmeasures in order to conserve and protect plant, fish and wildlifehabitat.
(c)
Implementation. The County shall requirethat each application for shore erosion protection demonstrate howit complies with the following objectives:
(1)
Structural control measures shall only be used in areas whereappreciable erosion occurs and where non-structural measures wouldnot be practical or effective in controlling erosion.
(2)
Where structural erosion control is required, the measure thatbest provides for conservation of fish and plant habitat and whichis practical and effective shall be used;
(3)
Non-structural measures shall be utilized in areas of erosionwhere they would be a practical and effective method of erosion control;
(4)
Structural erosion measures shall not be encouraged in areaswhere no significant erosion occurs;
(5)
If significant alterations in the characteristics of a shorelineoccur, the measure that best fits the change may be used for sitesin that area.
(d)
Process. The County, in reviewing anyapplication for a permit for structural erosion control devices, shallrefer the application to the Soil Conservation District and to the
Department of Natural Resources for field verification of the needfor the structural erosion control as well as for recommendationson proposed erosion control mechanisms.
(1)
Any application made to the County for the installation of anerosion control device must, at a minimum, include the following information:
A.
Photograph of erosion problem;
B.
The specific location of the site on a U.S. Geological Survey
7 1/2 minute topographic quadrangle map (scale 1:24,000);
C.
Soil type and erodibility;
D.
Proposed and existing land use.
(2)
Applications must include appropriate authorization from the
Maryland Department of the Environment and the U.S. Army Corps of
