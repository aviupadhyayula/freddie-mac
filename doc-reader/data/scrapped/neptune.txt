[[CONTENT]]
[Ord. No. 494 Preamble]
There exists in the Township insanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodationsand persons of low income who are forced to reside in such insanitaryor unsafe accommodations. There is a shortage of safe or sanitarydwelling accommodations available at rents which persons of low incomecan afford and such persons are forced to occupy overcrowded and congesteddwelling accommodations. These conditions cause an increase in andspread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health,safety, morale and welfare of the residents of the Township, and impaireconomic values. These conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionateexpenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment,public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and otherpublic services and facilities. These areas in the Township cannotbe cleared, nor can the shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings forpersons of low income be relieved, through the operation of privateenterprise, and the construction of housing projects for persons oflow income (as defined in the Local Housing Authorities Law) wouldtherefore not be competitive with private enterprise. The clearance,replanning and reconstruction of the areas in which insanitary orunsafe housing conditions exist and the providing of safe and sanitarydwelling accommodations by any public body for persons of low incomeare public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent andprivate property acquired and are governmental functions. There isa need for housing for elderly persons of low income.

a. Employees who are injured on the job, who are not capable of returningto work full duty but are physically capable to perform modified duty,will be required to report to work for modified duty as assigned bythe Business Administrator, Human Resources Director, or departmenthead until they are reasonably able to transition to their previousposition or transfer to a permanent position with the Township thatdoes not exceed their capabilities. In the event such modified dutyincludes classroom training, such training shall occur at sites designatedby the Township and comprehensive training examinations will be conducteddaily. Any employee requiring therapy during the work day would bereleased to attend such therapy. Once an employee is returned to workfull duty, any employee who requires further therapy will not be releasedto attend such therapy during the regular work day. Such therapy mustbe scheduled on the employee's personal time.
b. Any employee who has a stable non-work or work-related injury orillness will be required to return to work full duty within 30 dayspost injury or be subject to termination unless significant progresshas been documented by the attending physician, by the transitionalwork program, or by the physician or therapist performing the fit-for-dutyemployment testing no more than every 30 days as status changes afterthe injury or illness. Employees who continue to show significantprogress up to 30 days, but still cannot perform "full duty," mayhave up to three thirty-day extensions to this policy as determinedby the attending physician, by the transitional work program, or bythe physician or therapist performing the fit-for-duty employmenttesting.

Federal District Court has held thata "return to work program does not violate the Americans With Disabilities

At thediscretion of the Township, action may begin at any step, and/or certainsteps may be repeated or bypassed, depending on the severity and natureof the infraction and the employee's work/disciplinary record.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 9-13.2      Progressive Discipline.

[[CONTENT]]
The normal application of progressive discipline should be:
a. Step 1: Verbal Warning.
1. Step 1 creates an opportunity for the immediate supervisor to schedulea meeting with an employee to bring attention to the existing performance,conduct or attendance issue. The supervisor should discuss with theemployee the nature of the problem or the violation of company policiesand procedures. The supervisor is expected to clearly describe expectationsand steps the employee must take to improve performance or resolvethe problem. A corrective action plan must be implemented. This meetingis to be documented on an "Employee Warning Notice."
2. This meeting must be documented to ensure that the employee has aclear understanding of what is expected of him/her. Within one businessday of this meeting, the supervisor will prepare written documentationof a Step 1 meeting. The employee will be asked to sign the "Employee
Warning Notice" to demonstrate his or her understanding of the issuesand the corrective action.
b. Step 2: Written Warning.
1. Although the Township hopes that the employee will promptly correctany performance, conduct or attendance issues that were identifiedin Step 1, the Township recognizes that this may not always occur.
The Step 2 written warning involves more detailed documentation ofthe performance, conduct or attendance issues and consequences.
2. During Step 2, the immediate supervisor and a division manager ordirector will meet with the employee to review any additional incidentsor information about the performance, conduct or attendance issuesas well as any prior relevant corrective action plans. Managementwill outline the consequences for the employee of his or her continuedfailure to meet performance or conduct expectations.
c. Step 3: Suspension and Final Written Warning.
1. There may be performance, conduct or safety incidents so problematicand harmful that the most effective action may be the temporary removalof the employee from the workplace. When immediate action is necessaryto ensure the safety of the employee or others, the immediate supervisormay suspend the employee pending the results of an investigation.
2. Suspensions that are recommended as part of the normal progressionof this progressive discipline policy and procedure are subject toapproval from a next-level manager and the Human Resources Department.
3. Depending on the seriousness of the infraction, the employee maybe suspended without pay in full-day increments consistent with federal,state and local wage-and-hour employment laws. Nonexempt/hourly employeesmay not substitute or use an accrued paid vacation or sick day inlieu of the unpaid suspension unless approved by the Township Administrator.
Due to Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) compliance issues, unpaid suspensionof salaried/exempt employees is reserved for serious workplace safetyor conduct issues. The Township Administrator will provide guidanceso that the discipline is administered without jeopardizing the FLSA
exemption status. The Township Administrator will advise.
4. Pay may be restored to the employee if an investigation of the incidentor infraction absolves the employee.
d. Step 4: Recommendation for Termination of Employment.
1. The last and most serious step in the progressive discipline procedureis a recommendation to terminate employment. Generally, the Townshipwill exercise the progressive nature of this policy by first providingdocumented verbal warning with corrective action plan, written warningwith performance improvement plan, a final written warning or suspensionfrom the workplace with performance improvement plan before proceedingto a recommendation to terminate employment. However, the Townshipreserves the right to combine and skip steps depending on the circumstancesof each situation and the nature of the offense. Furthermore, employeesmay be terminated without prior notice or disciplinary action.
2. Management's recommendation to terminate employment must be approvedby the Township Administrator and Committee. The Township Administratorshall also consult with the Township's Labor Counsel in terminationcases. Final determination of termination of an employee will be providedin writing.
e. Performance and Conduct Issues Not Subject to Progressive Discipline.
Behavior that is illegal is not subject to progressive discipline,and such behavior may be reported to local law enforcement authorities.
Typically, the supervisor should suspend the employee immediately
(with or without pay) and an investigation of the incidents leadingup to the suspension should be conducted to determine if any furtheraction, such as termination, should be taken.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 9-13.3      Appeal of Disciplinary Action.

[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 9-22.6      Reasonable Cause Testing.

[[CONTENT]]
a. A driver may be required to submit to alcohol and/or controlled substancestesting based on the Township's reasonable suspicion that the driverhas violated the provisions of this policy.
b. Reasonable suspicion must be based on specific, contemporaneous,articulable observations concerning the driver's appearance, behavior,speech, odor, and/or indications of use or withdrawal of alcohol/controlledsubstances prohibited by this policy.
c. Whenever practicable, at least two supervisors should confer andagree that reasonable suspicion exists to request the employee tosubmit to testing. However, when only one supervisor is available,the use of only one supervisor is permissible.
1. Questioning of Employees. When acting on reasonable suspicion thatthe employee may be in violation of this policy, a supervisor shallmake all attempts to respect an employee's privacy. Therefore, whentime permits, a supervisor is to first consult with management priorto initiating any conversation with the employee regarding their compliancewith this policy. Other guidelines include:
(a)
Questioning should be limited to general condition (e.g., doesthe employee feel sick, do they know where they are, to whom are theytalking, and what may be the cause of the employee's present condition).
(b)
Care must be taken to unnecessarily identify the employee tocoworkers when initiating conversations concerning violations of thispolicy. In most instances this will mean the employee is to be questionedaway from their designated job station and from other employees' abilityto overhear the conversation. However, such removal from a job stationin itself may needlessly identify an employee, and therefore, it maybe appropriate in some circumstances to begin questioning at the employee'swork station.
(c)
Management and supervisors are to limit their conversationsregarding possible violations of this policy to those persons whoare participating in any questioning, evaluation, investigation, ordisciplinary action on a need-to-know basis. Management and supervisorsare to instruct other employees, except as stated above, not to talkabout such possible violations.
d. In all instances, the supervisor(s) shall make a written record ofthe observations leading to reasonable suspicion testing. Such recordshall be signed by the supervisor who made such observations within
24 hours of observed behavior or release of the test results (whicheveris earlier). Whenever practicable, a copy of this form will accompanythe employee to the medical testing facility. Reasonable cause testingshould not be based solely on third-person observations or reports,unless the supervisor(s) can verify and indicate further such observationsto be reliable.
e. Any driver requested to submit to screening under reasonable causecircumstances will be immediately escorted by a Township officialto a designated testing facility for the submission of a urine, breathand/or blood sample. Any machinery being used by the affected employeewill be immediately taken out of operation until inspected and clearedfor reuse.
f. After a sample has been provided, the employee under this sectionof this policy will not be permitted to operate Township machineryand will be directed home. The employee will wait in a designatedarea until arrangements are made for the transportation of the employeeto their home. The Township will first attempt to contact the employee'sspouse or member of their family. In the event no one can be contacted,
Neptune Township and its agencies will make arrangements to transportthe employee to their home. If the employee rejects these alternatives,the Township will take appropriate measures to discourage the employeefrom operating his vehicle, including contacting law enforcement officialsif necessary.
g. Employees requested to submit to testing under reasonable cause circumstanceswill be suspended pending the results of the test. If the test resultsare negative, the employee will be reinstated with full pay and employeeentitlements. If the results are positive, the employee may be subjectto discipline up to and including termination as effective from thedate of suspension.
h. Noncompliance by Employees.
1. Management and supervisors are not to attempt to use force in seekingcompliance with requests. Security personnel or possibly local lawenforcement officials should be called if the supervisor determinesthat the employee should not be allowed to remain in the work areaand the employee refuses to leave.
2. The supervisor is to explain to the employee that noncompliance withthe supervisor's requests to submit to alcohol and/or drug testingunder this policy, to disclose and explain the nature of any suspectedsubstance, to leave the work area or Township facility, or any otherreasonable request will be viewed as insubordination and subject todiscipline, including (but not limited to) termination for a firsttime refusal or any subsequent refusal.

[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 12-5.1      Findings, Declaration Relative to Abandoned Properties.

[[CONTENT]]
[Ord. No. 2014-36]
a. The Township Committee finds and declares that:
1. Abandoned properties, particularly those located within urban areasor in close proximity to occupied residences and businesses, createa wide range of problems for the communities in which they are located,fostering criminal activity, creating public health problems and otherwisediminishing the quality of life for residents and business operatorsin those areas.
2. Abandoned properties diminish the property values of neighboringproperties and have a negative effect on the quality of life of adjacentproperty owners, increasing the risk of property damage through arsonand vandalism and discouraging neighborhood stability and revitalization.
3. For these reasons, abandoned properties are presumptively consideredto be nuisances, in view of their negative effects on nearby propertiesand the residents or users of those properties.
4. The continued presence of abandoned properties in New Jersey'scommunities acts as a significant barrier to urban revitalizationand to the regeneration of the State's urban centers.
5. Abandonment is a local problem that must be addressed locally andthe most important role of State government is to provide local governments,local community organizations, citizens, and residents with the toolsto address the problem.
6. The responsibility of a property owner and in some cases the lienholderto maintain a property in sound condition and prevent it from becominga nuisance to others extends to properties which are not in use and
"demolition by neglect", leading to the deterioration and loss ofthe property, or failure by an owner and in some cases the lienholderto comply with legitimate orders to demolish, stabilize or otherwiserepair his or her or its property creates a presumption that the ownerand in some cases the lienholder has abandoned the property.
7. Many abandoned buildings still have potential value for residentialand other uses and such buildings should be preserved rather thandemolished wherever feasible, particularly buildings that have historicor architectural value, or contribute to maintaining the characterof neighborhoods or streetscapes, or both, as the case may be.

et seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental unitsto adopt regulations designed to promote public health, safety, andgeneral welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Township Committeeof the Township of Neptune, County of Monmouth, New Jersey does ordainas follows.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 19-1.2      Findings of Fact.

[[CONTENT]]
[Ord. No. 09-38]
a. The flood hazard areas of the Township of Neptune are subject toperiodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, healthand safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect thepublic health, safety, and general welfare.
b. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructionsin areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights andvelocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in otherareas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwiseprotected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 19-1.3      Statement of Purpose.

[[CONTENT]]
[Ord. No. 09-38]
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health,safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private lossesdue to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
a. To protect human life and health;
b. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood controlprojects;
c. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated withflooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
d. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
e. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as waterand gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridgeslocated in areas of special flood hazard;
f. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second useand development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimizefuture flood blight areas;
g. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is inan area of special flood hazard; andh. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazardassume responsibility for their actions.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 19-1.4      Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.

[[CONTENT]]
[Ord. No. 09-38]
In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includesmethods and provisions for:
a. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damagingincreases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
b. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities whichserve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time ofinitial construction;
c. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channelfloodwaters;
d. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development whichmay increase flood damage; ande. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers whichwill unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazardsin other areas.

3. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Planning Board, or any taxpayer,may appeal such decision to the Monmouth County Construction Boardof Appeals, as provided in N.J.A.C. 5:27D-127.
4. In passing upon such applications, the Planning Board, shall considerall technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specifiedin other sections of this chapter, and:
(a)
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to theinjury of others;
(b)
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(c)
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contentsto flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(d)
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facilityto the community;
(e)
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, whereapplicable;
(f)
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed usewhich are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(g)
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipateddevelopment;
(h)
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive planand floodplain management program of that area;
(i)
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinaryand emergency vehicles;
(j)
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, andsediment transport of the flood-waters and the effects of wave action,if applicable, expected at the site; and
(k)
The costs of providing governmental services during and afterflood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilitiesand facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems,and streets and bridges.
5. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection 19-4.4a4 and thepurposes of this chapter, the Planning Board may attach such conditionsto the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further thepurposes of this chapter.
6. The Construction Official shall maintain the records of all appealactions, including technical information, and report any variancesto the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
b. Conditions for Variances.
1. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantialimprovements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or lessin size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structuresconstructed below the base flood level, providing items (a)—(k)

[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 20-2.1      Determination by Township Committee.

[[CONTENT]]
[Ord. No. 1492 preamble]
The Township Committee has determined that certain food plasticscontaining chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which constitute non-recyclablewaste, release dangerous toxic fumes when incinerated.
The plastic food service products are made up of a compositionof chemical products such as "CFCs" polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride,and Styrofoam.
The Township Committee has determined that certain food serviceplastics create a danger to the health and welfare of the citizensof Neptune and create a danger to the environment.
These products have readily available substitutes.


[[SECTIONTITLE]]
§ 20-2.2      Finding and Purpose.

[[CONTENT]]
[Ord. No. 1492 § 1]
The Township Committee finds and declares as follows:
a. Available scientific evidence indicates a strong probability thatthe family of substances known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), whendischarged into the atmosphere, degrades the earth's protectivelayer of ozone, allowing increased amounts of ultraviolet radiationto penetrate the atmosphere, posing an acute and immediate dangerto human health, life and the environment. Available scientific evidenceindicates that there is a strong possibility that the resulting increasein ultraviolet radiation may already have caused an increase in theincidence of skin cancers and other serious illnesses.
b. One (1) source of the CFCs currently being released into the atmosphereis the use of these substances as blowing agents in the manufactureof some of the polystyrene foam packaging products used in the foodservices industry. There are substitutes for these products currentlyavailable which do not use CFCs in their manufacture.
c. The people and the Township support international, Federal and Statebans on all uses of CFCs not deemed absolutely essential. Until suchbans are in effect, responsible action to reduce CFCs use and alertthe public to the danger posed by these substances must be undertakenat the local level.
d. It is the intent of the Township Committee to reduce the amount of
CFCs-processed products purchased and used by the Township and peopleof Neptune and thereby to reduce the health hazards created by themanufacture of these products.
